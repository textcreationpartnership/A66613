            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

the queſtion is for the Tithes of corn and thoſe do appertain to the Parſon and not to the Vicar, and he cited a caſe between <hi>Hawk</hi> and <hi>Collins</hi> in this Court; there the preſcription was, that he and all thoſe, whoſe eſtate he had, had uſed to pay to the Vicar a certain thing in le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

And the compoſition being made before time of memory, no man can ſay but that it was made in ſuch manner, and the caſe of <hi>Okenden Cowper</hi> in this Court, in which the Court was divided, differed from this caſe, for there the preſcription was to pay a Buck ariſing and coming out of the Park, and there was no deer left in the Park: and <hi>Hutton</hi> agreed, for there he deſtroyed his own preſcription, and he agreed with <hi>Bracies</hi> caſe put after, for there was a contrariety in the preſcription. <hi>Warberton;</hi> the caſe of <hi>Bracie</hi> in this Court was, that the Parſon libelled againſt him for the Tithe of corn, where this was due to the Vicar and not to the Parſon and denyed him for that reaſon, for he may not plead the title of another man; and the Parſon and the Vicar ought to agree among themſelves; but in our caſe no Tithes are to be ſet out, and for that reaſon he may plead this, but it ſeems to me that the preſcription ſhall go to the ſoyle, and not to the Park &amp; when it is deſtroyed, he ſhall pay Tithes in kind as a garden or an orchard, ſo long as it is uſed as a garden or an orchard, that the occupier of that ſhall pay a peny: now if this be ploughed and converted to other uſe, he ſhall pay Tithes in kinde: and <hi>Hobert</hi> agreed to the caſe of the garden or orchard, for the penny is paid for the herbs or fruite. <hi>Winch</hi> was abſent: and <hi>Hutton</hi> ſaid, that the preſcription ſhall go to the ſoyle, and the Vicar by preſcription may have the herbs of the glbe of the Parſon: <hi>Hobert,</hi> the Park is only an appellation or name of land, and this name or appellation may not pay Tithes, but the land it ſelf: and put the caſe that a man had al-wayes paid 10. s. for the Tithes of a meadow, and after he ſowed that with corn, here for the payment of this 10. s. he is diſcharged: <hi>War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berton,</hi> I deny the caſe of the meadow; and ſo it was adjorned.</p>

the other 3 ſit as Commiſſioners, and he who refuſed was ſworn and examined by them as a witneſs, and ruled that this is good, for though he refuſed to be a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioner, yet he is not excluded to be ſworn as a witneſs.</p>

                  <p>IN a Replevin for the taking of a horſe in 5. acres of land in ſuch a place, and the Defendant avowed as Bayliff to <hi>Sir George Spark,</hi> and ſhewed that <hi>Sir George Spark,</hi> and all thoſe whoſe eſtate he had in the land, had uſed time beyond the memory of man to have herbage and paſturage in all the 5. acres when that was not ſowen, and upon this plea the Plantiff demurred; <hi>Aſhley</hi> argued for the Plantiff, that the preſcription is void, and this is not like to the caſe of a common, for a man may preſcribe to have common in another mans land, for this is but a reception of the profits with the mouthes of his cattle, but in our caſe it is all one as to preſcribe to have the land it ſelf, and I may not preſcribe to have land it ſelf, for I may not ſay that I and my anceſtors had uſed to have ſuch land, for ſuch a preſcription is void: to which <hi>Hobert chief Iuſtice</hi> and all the Court agreed as to that point, and then to prove that this is all one as to preſcribe to have the land it ſelf, he ſaid that if a man lets the profits, and the herbage of land for years, this is a leaſe of the land it ſelf, as was lately adjudged in this Court; which was alſo granted by the Court, alſo he ſaid that this appears by the 27. of <hi>H.</hi> 8. 12. that a man ſhall have a <hi>praecipe quod reddat</hi> of paſturage or herbage, but not of common, and a <hi>formedon</hi> lyes of paſturage 4. <hi>E.</hi> 4. 2. &amp; the <hi>Regiſt. fo.</hi> 177. <hi>Ejectione firme</hi> lyes of paſturage; and ſo he concluded that upon the matter he preſcribed to have the land it ſelf; but <hi>Hobert chief Iuſtice</hi> and all the Court to the contrary, that
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:95435:8" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the preſcription is good, for that may have a good beginning by grant, for a man may lawfully grant the paſturage and the feeding of his land when that is not ſowed, and by conſequence, if that may be good by grant, it may be good by preſcription; and judgement was commanded to be entered for the Defendant.

of <hi>H.</hi> 6. <hi>cap.</hi> 10. that no Sheriff may take an obligation by colour of his office in other manner or form then is there preſcribed by the Statute, and he ſhewed that a Statute of 200. l. was acknowledged to him, the Defendant by <hi>I.

And firſt <hi>Hendon</hi> argued that this bond with penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is out of the Statute, of the 29. <hi>Eliz.</hi> for firſt in our caſe the bond is void, by the 23. <hi>H.</hi> 6. for it is taken to another, and not to the Sheriff, and beſides the ſame Statute doth not extend to any obligation with penalty, and then it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver was the intent of the 29. <hi>of Eliz.</hi> that any other ſhould be taken, or after another manner, and the Statute of the 23. <hi>H.</hi> 6. was made only to prevent the extortion of the Sheriffs, and of their officers, as may appear by a particular recital of the Statute: and yet he agreed that by the equity of the ſame Statute, he ſhall have 4. d. for every warrant as appears by the new book of entries: and then he ſaid, if the Sheriff take other fees, or in other manner it is extortion: and for that by 21. <hi>H.</hi> 7. if he takes an obligation, or covenant which tends to extortion, the law will meet with that, and he relyed much upon <hi>Manninghams caſe Com.</hi> 65. where it is ſaid, the Sheriff may take a bond, with a great penalty for the appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of the party, but not for his fees by the Stat. of 23. <hi>H.</hi> 6. for that Stat. as to fees is not repealed by the 29. <hi>Eliz.</hi> and ſo he concluded this bond with penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty for his fees was extortion, and void by 23. <hi>H.</hi> 6. which is not repealed by the 29. <hi>Eliz.</hi> and by conſequence void, for that Statute was not made to puniſh them, but to prevent all extortion in them; and this Statute is penued ſtrictly to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent any thing which had but any colour of extortion, like to the Statute of the 13. of <hi>Eliz. cap.</hi> 8. againſt uſury, if any evaſion be made by any indirect dealing to avoid this, yet the Statute will meet with that, as appeares in <hi>Claytons caſe:</hi> and for that reaſon he concluded this bond with a penalty to be void.</p>
                  <p>But admitting the bond to be good, the Sheriff had not taken that in due time, for before the liberate there is no compleat execution, but otherwiſe in the caſe of a Statute Merchant, for there needs no liberate of it ſelf: ſee the <hi>books of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries</hi> 59. the difference agreed, by which it is apparent that before the liberate there is no compleat execution, and the words of the 29 of <hi>Eliz.</hi> are for the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving and the executing &amp;c. ſo that before execution the Sheriff ſhall have nothing, for this word (for) implies a condition precedent, as an annuity <hi>pro conſilio impenſo;</hi> he ought to ſhew that he had given counſel; and yet it is true that this Statute of the 29. <hi>Eliz.</hi> hath made a contract between the Sheriff, and the party that hath execution, and he may have his contract, for it is a contract in law, and ſo it was reſolved, but he ſhall not have that before execution, as was holden, <hi>Paſch.</hi> 14. <hi>Iac.

hundred pound, for the intent of the Statute is to put that incertainty, and not to make fractions; but it will be objected the inconvenience that will enſue upon this conſtruction, for then the Sheriff ſhall have as much for the executing of 100. l. as for 200. l. to this he anſwered that this may well be, for it is the words of the Statute: and for authority in that point he cited the caſe of <hi>Foſſet and the Sheriff of Nottingham Paſch.</hi> 36. <hi>Eliz.

                  <p>The Defendant pleaded <hi>nihil debet per legem,</hi> and upon that the Plantiff de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murred in law; and the queſtion was whether the Defendant may wage his law, and it was argued by <hi>Serjeant Harvey</hi> that he ſhall not wage his law, for this is only an action upon the caſe, and ſounds only in nonfeſance, and here is no privity between the Plantiff and Defendant; for the bill was made over the ſea, and ſubcribed here in <hi>England,</hi> and he ſhall not charge the Defendant without a ſpecial cuſtome, ſo that it is plaine that it is cuſtome which made the Defendant lyable, and if the Defendant do not pay for this no action of debt lyes, but only an action upon the caſe: and every plea ought to conclude to the point in action: and for that in trover and converſion <hi>non culp.</hi> is a good plea: and yet he may traverſe the finding, for this tends to the iſſue, and is good; and ſo in debt upon a leaſe for years, <hi>nihil debet</hi> is a good plea, or <hi>non dimiſit,</hi> for the cauſe aforeſaid, but when the plea doth not tend to the point in iſſue, it is otherwiſe, for he ought to traverſe that which tends to the point in iſſue, and in our caſe the Defendant may traverſe the cuſtome, or give anſwer to the nonfeſance, but he ſhall not wage his law; and an action lyes upon this contract againſt the <hi>Mr.</hi> for this, and ſo he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded that judgement ought to be given for the Plantiff.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Harris Serjeant contrary;</hi> this non payment is not a non feſance in the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant; and here the Defendant may not plead not guilty, or <hi>non aſſumpſit,</hi> for no promiſe was made, and it is a general rule in law, that where a man may tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe the conveyance, there he ſhall not wage his law: ſee 5. <hi>H.</hi> 7. but here the Defendant may not traverſe the conveyance, <hi>Ergo</hi> he may wage his law, and 5. <hi>H.</hi> 7. the ſucceſſor of an Abbot ſhall have his law of a contract made with his predeceſſor, and he ſaid that the book of the 23. <hi>E.</hi> 3. is not law. <hi>Hobert chief Iuſtice</hi> if the Bayliff at the common law make a ſubſtitute, the ſubſtitute is not chargeable, but here the cuſtome will bind the law. Secondly he laid 2. or 3. Merchants trade over the ſea who made a factor there, who takes money there, and gives a bill, and this is ſubſcribed by one of the company, that this ſhould bind all or any of the company is not a good cuſtome, and the cuſtome of Merchants is part of the common law of this Kingdome, of which the judges ought to take notice: and if any doubt ariſe to them about there cuſtome, they may ſend for the Merchants to know there cuſtome, as they may ſend for the Civillians to know

there law, and he thought that the Defendant ought to be admitted to wage his law, for the delivery of the money made a contract in law, and as he may have an action of debt, ſo without queſtion he may have an action upon the caſe, and ſo count upon a promiſe, and then the Defendant may not wage his law.</p>

                     <hi>DOctor Hunt</hi> brought an action of debt upon an obligation of 100. l. againſt the heire of <hi>Edmond Allen,</hi> and the condition of the obligation was, that whereas the teſtator <hi>Edmond Allen,</hi> in the firſt year of the raigne of the King, hath given and granted to the Plantiff the preſentation to the Church of <hi>D.</hi> if therefore the ſaid <hi>Edmond Alllen,</hi> from time to time ſhall make good the ſaid grant from all incumberances made, or to be made by him, and his heirs, that then &amp;c. and the grantor dyed, and the Church became void: and the heire of the grantor preſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and whether this was a breach of the Condition, was the queſtion; and <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert chief Iuſtice and Winch</hi> being only preſent, thought this tortious preſentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to be no breach of the condition, but this extends only to lawful diſturbance by the heire, and by the pleading here it appears, that though the heire preſented, yet he had no right to preſent, becauſe that his father had granted that before: and then the preſentation of the heire is as a meer ſtranger. And thoſe general words will not extend to a tortious diſturbance by the heire: but <hi>Hobert</hi> ſaid, that the words ſhall have ſuch a conſtruction as if it had been ſaid, that he ſhall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy the ſame, from any act or acts made by him, or his heires: and in this caſe there ought to be a lawful eviction to make a breach of the condition: but otherwiſe if the condition had been that he ſhall peaceably enjoy from any act or acts made by him, or his heires, in that caſe a tortious diſturbance would have been a breach of the condition, but it was adjorned till another time.</p>
                  <p>Information was for that one ſuch, his apprentice, departed out of his ſervice, and the Defendant received and retained him without a teſtimonial from the <hi>Mr. contra formam Statuti.</hi> And ſo he demanded 5. l. the Defendant pleaded <hi>nihil debet per patriam,</hi> and it was found againſt him: and now <hi>Hendon Serjeant</hi> moved in arreſt of judgement, that an apprentice is out of the clauſe of the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of the 5th. of <hi>Elizabeth;</hi> and that the ſame Statute extends only to ſervants, and to labourers retained within that Statute, for the ſtatute ſaith, be it enacted that no perſon or perſons that depart out of ſervice without ſhewing of a teſtimoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, as is above remembered, and this branch as is above remembered, had only reference to the next clauſe before, and the ſame branch before makes only menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of certaine trades, in which an apprentice as in our caſe is not included: and the certificate ſet down within the Statute, proves that an apprentice is not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Statute, for the words are <hi>I.

                     </note> and therefore he is within the expreſs words of the ſame branch. Thirdly, the form of the teſtimonial proves that, for it is <hi>I. W.</hi> ſervant to ſuch &amp;c. and an apprentice is ſuch a ſervant. <hi>Hobert chief Iuſtice</hi> ſaid, that it was never the intent of the Statute, to make an infant who is an apprentice, to be within the danger of the ſame Statute, for an infant at the age of 14. years may be bound to be an apprentice: and the puniſhment which is given by the ſame Statute is, that ſuch perſon ſhall be whipt as a Rogue, which plainly proves the Statute, intends only thoſe who are of full age: and if other conſtruction ſhall be made, perchance that the ſonne of a gentleman may be puniſhed as a Rogue by ſuch departure: and he held that if an apprentice depart with his <hi>Mrs.</hi> goods delivered to him, that in this caſe he is not within the Statute of the 21. <hi>H</hi> 8. as another ſervant is; and <hi>Serjeant Finch</hi> ſaid, that there is an expreſs exception, and if that had not been, that an apprentice had been within the danger of the law; but <hi>Hobert</hi> ſaid, that he doubted much whether an apprentice had been within that Statute, though the Proviſo had not been made, but this proves that the makers of the Statute, thought this to be a hard matter to make an infant who is apprentice to be within the danger of the ſame law: and for that reaſon the proviſo of the Statute was made. <hi>Winch</hi> ſaid to which <hi>Hutton</hi> agreed, that when the Defendant had pleaded <hi>nihil debet,</hi> and this was found for the Plant<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

have the rents, and the profits &amp;c. and the jury found over that he made two ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecutors and 3. who were overſeers, and that the 3. <hi>October</hi> 16. <hi>Iac.</hi> died, and that within 3. weeks after the death of the deviſor, the executor read the will to the overſeers, but they found that the overſeers did not remember that; and if upon all the matter <hi>Griffith and Anne</hi> his wife had not performed the condition was the queſtion: and that if not, the reverſion was in the Plantiff. And the point in law upon the verdict was whether <hi>Griffith and Anne</hi> his wife, ought of their perils to tender the bond within 3. moneths, or whether the overſeers ought to make the firſt act, and to tender the bond and the penalty for them to ſeal; and <hi>Towſe Serjeant</hi> argued that <hi>Anne</hi> and <hi>Griffith</hi> her husband ought to tender the bond at their peril, for he ſaid, that the condition did precede the eſtate, and therefore if they will have the benefit of the deviſe, then he ought to tender the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation; and vouched <hi>Corbets caſe,</hi> and 18. <hi>Eliz.</hi> the deviſe of land upon condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to pay money, he ought to pay that at his perill: <hi>Attoe Serjeant</hi> contrary, and yet he agreed, that if the condition was to precede the eſtate, then the law was as <hi>Towſe</hi> had ſaid, but here he ſaid the eſtate precedes the condition, for all the profits are deviſed to <hi>Griffith</hi> and to <hi>Anne</hi> his wife during the minority of the Plantiff, by which it is apparent the eſtate is preſently in the deviſees; and by conſequence the eſtate precedes the condition; and then the ſole doubt will be whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Griffith</hi> and <hi>Anne</hi> his wife ought to procure the overſeers to make the obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and to limit the condition, or whether the overſeers ought to make this firſt, they being the parties inſtruſted by the Will: ſee more after.</p>

S.</hi> had made of feofment in fee of the ſame land to <hi>I. S.</hi> and that the feoffee continued in poſſeſſion at the time of the making of the obligation: and upon this the Defendant demurred: and in this caſe two points were moved; firſt, when I am obliged that <hi>I. S.</hi> who is a ſtranger, ſhall levy a fine to the obligee, whether in this caſe the obligee is bound to ſue a writ of covenant, and it was argued by <hi>Serjeant Harvy</hi> that not, yet he agreed that if the condition was, that the obligor ſhall levy a fine to the obligee, in this caſe the obligee ought to do the firſt act, <hi>viz.</hi> to ſue a writ of covenant, as <hi>Palmers caſe Cooke</hi> 5. but otherwiſe when the fine is levied by a third perſon, for there the obligor had took all upon him 4. <hi>H.</hi> 7. 15. <hi>E.</hi> 4. if I am bound to marry the daughter of <hi>I. S.</hi> and ſhe will not marry me, yet I have forfited my obligation, and ſo here he ought to leavy a fine at his perill, and at his own coſts, or at the coſts of the obligor. But admitting that the obligee ought to ſue a writ of cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, becauſe it appears by the replication that before the obligation made, <hi>I. <hi>S.</hi>
                     </hi> had made a feofment over, and that the feoffee did continue poſſeſſion at the time when the fine was to be leavied; and therefore the obligee needs not to ſue forth any writ of covenant, becauſe he who is to leavy the fine had diſabled himſelf to perform that; and he urged <hi>Sir Anthony Maines caſe</hi> where <hi>Cooke</hi> 5. the party needs not to tender a Surrender becauſe that he who had the reverſion had granted that over before the Surrender was to be made.</p>

                     <hi>Serjeant Hendon</hi> to the contrary, for he argued that the obligation is not forfeit, except the obligee ſue a writ of covenant, and there is no difference between this caſe, and when the obligor himſelf was to leavy a fine, for the obligor had not undertaken for the whole fine, but only that <hi>I. <hi>S.</hi>
                     </hi> ſhall acknowledge a fine, and if the obligor ſhall be compelled at his perill to ſue a writ of covenant, then you will conſtrue the condition to extend to an unlawfull act, for it ſhall be maintenance in him to ſue forth a writ of covenant, &amp; he vouched a caſe <hi>P.</hi> 4 <hi>Iac.

S.</hi> had diſmiſſed himſelf of the land, for the words are general that <hi>I. S.</hi> ſhall leavy a fine, and this he ought to do, though no eſtate paſs by the fine, for a fine upon releaſe ſhall be a good performance of the Condition, but otherwiſe if it had been to make a feofment in fee, for a man cannot make a feofment except he be ſeiſed of the land at the time, as 31. <hi>E.</hi> 3. <hi>debt.</hi> 164. a man was obliged to preſent the obligee to ſuch a Church, and the obligee took a wife by which he had diſabled himſelf to be a perſon, yet the obligor ought to preſent him, for otherwiſe he ſhall forfeit his obligation, and ſo in this caſe <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert and Hutton</hi> as to the firſt point held the barre to be good, and that the obligee ought to ſue forth the writ of Covenant, for <hi>Hobert</hi> ſaid he ought to do that, for it is no reaſon to compel the obligor who is a ſtranger to the eſtate which paſſeth by the fine to ſue a writ of Covenant, and for that reaſon, if I am bound to compel you to come upon ſuch land to take a feofment, I am not bound that the other make a livery of ſeiſin, but if the caſe was that I was obliged to you, that <hi>I. S.</hi> ſhall leavy a fine to <hi>I. N.</hi> in ſuch caſe the fine ought to be leavied at my peril, though that <hi>I. N.</hi> will not ſue a writ of Covenant; <hi>Hutton</hi> according, but <hi>Winch</hi> doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of the caſe, and as to the ſecond point <hi>Hutton</hi> and <hi>Hobert</hi> agreed that the obligee as this caſe is needs not to ſue a writ of Covenant, becauſe that <hi>I. S.</hi> had made a feofment of the land before, and ſo had diſabled himſelf at the time of the obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, for now it is impoſſible to leavy a good fine, for if he ſhould enter into the land and put out the feoffee, this were not good within the condition; and <hi>Hutton</hi> ſaid, it ought to be agreed that if <hi>I. S.</hi> had made a feofment after the time of the making of the obligation, and ſo had diſabled himſelf afterwards, and the obligor is bound that a fine ſhall be leavied, this is to be underſtood of a good and a lawfull fine, and not a fine in name only; and he put the caſe; that I let for years, and after Covenant to make a feofment to <hi>I. S.</hi> this leaſe for years is a breach of the Condition, though at the time of the Covenant made the leaſe for years was made. <hi>Iuſtice Winch</hi> thought the contrary, for this diſability is by the act of a ſtranger, and for that the obligor may not take any certain notice of that, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if I am obliged to you, that <hi>I. S.</hi> ſhall enfeoffe you of his Mannor, and at the time <hi>I. <hi>S.</hi>
                     </hi> had made a feoffement of two or three acres of the ſame Mannor, yet if he enfeoffe you of that which he was ſeiſed at the time of the obligation, this is a good performance of the Condition, though that 2. or 3. acres were disjoyned from that before, and ſo in this caſe the obligor being a ſtranger to the eſtate of <hi>I. S.</hi> if <hi>I. S.</hi> make ſuch an eſtate as he had at the time of the obligation made, this is ſufficient, upon which he concluded, that the Plantiff ſhall not have judgement, but afterward judgement was commanded to be entered for the Plantiff according to the opinion of <hi>Hobert</hi> and <hi>Hutton.</hi>

                  <p>IN Replevin the Defendant avowed as Baliff to <hi>Sir Francis Barrington,</hi> and that <hi>Whitgift</hi> the Plantiff held certaine land of <hi>Sir Francis Barrington,</hi> by eſcuage <hi>et quendam reditum,</hi> and that the ſaid <hi>Sir Francis</hi> was ſeiſed by the hands of <hi>Whitgift</hi> his very Tenant, and for homage he avowed; and upon this the Plaintiff demurred; firſt, becauſe he had avowed for homage, and had not ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed how nor in what manner the homage is due, whether in reſpect that the tenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy come to him by diſcent, or by purchaſe, and for that this general allegation is naught, for by <hi>Hendon Serjeant</hi> all the preſidents in ſuch avowryes made menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the title to the homage, as 4. <hi>E.</hi> 4. in avowry for homage, the tenure is ſhewed, and a diſcent alleadged, or a purchaſe of the land, and in no book or in any preſident that he ever yet ſaw, did he ſee ſuch a general allegation in avowry for homage, but he agreeth the book of the 44. <hi>E.</hi> 3. 42. if the avowry is upon tenant by the curteſie, this general allegation is good, but otherwiſe of a tenant in fee ſimple; and for that he alledged the ſecond <hi>E.</hi> 3. avowry in a replevin, the Biſhop avowed for homage due by the Plantiff, and exception was taken, becauſe it was not ſhewed in whoſe time the death of the anceſtor was, whether in his own time, or the time of his predeceſſor, and ruled to be evill, for his avowry being his title he ought to ſhew that in certaine, and ſo in our caſe. <hi>Hobert</hi> this caſe doth not prove our caſe, for in our caſe <hi>prima facie</hi> it is certain to all intents and purpoſes, and I cannot ſee how an avowry may be better made; and <hi>Finch</hi> at the barre vouched a preſident in the book of entries title <hi>horſe de ſon fee:</hi> ſecondly, where ſuch a avowry as in our caſe is made, and then <hi>Hendon</hi> moved that the avowrie is not good, for he had ſhewed the tenure by homage, and by eſcuage, and rent <hi>de quo quidem redditu,</hi> he was ſeiſed &amp;c. and this is alſo repugnant; for when he ſaid that he was ſeiſed of the rent by the hands of the Plaintiff, this is a ſeiſin of the homage as <hi>Bevils</hi> caſe is, and then by his own ſhewing, becauſe the ſeiſin of the rent is a ſeiſin of the homage, he ſhall not have the homage of the Plantiff.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, admitting this point againſt him, and that the ſeiſin of the rent is not ſeiſin of the homage, yet the pleading is not good, for when he expreſly alleadged ſeiſin of the rent in this manner <hi>de quo quidem redditu</hi> he was ſeiſed, this exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the ſeiſin of any other ſervices, but only of the rent which is expreſly alleadged: and therefore in our caſe he ought to have alleadged generally <hi>de quibus ſerviciis</hi> he was ſeiſed, and to leave this to the conſtruction of the Law; and he vouched 13. <hi>H.</hi> 7. 31. <hi>Serjeant Harvy</hi> to the ſame intent, for though perchance no good reaſon may be given wherefore the pleading ſhall be ſuch, and that the ſeiſin of the homage ought to be expreſſed, yet becauſe all the preſidents are ſo, the courſe of pleading ſhall not be altered: and all the preſidents ſhew a ſeiſin of the homage; ſee the book of entries 597. and 598.</p>

Thirdly, he doubted if the leſſee hold over his term ſo that he is tenant at ſufferance, what remedy the leſſor had for his rent.</p>
                  <p>Vpon the reading of a record the caſe was, that a <hi>Scire facias</hi> iſſued againſt the land, Tenant to have execution of a judgement given againſt <hi>Ferdinando Earl of Darby</hi> in the <hi>15.

Earl of Darby,</hi> and the jury found that the feofment was made by <hi>Edward Earl of Darby</hi> to the ſame perſons as the Defendant had pleaded, but this was to the uſe of the feoffor for life, the remainder over to the <hi>Lord Strange</hi> and his wife, the remainder as before; and whether this ſhall be intended the ſame Feofment which the Defendant had pleaded was the queſtion, becauſe the eſtate for life was omitted; and upon the ſpecial verdict that was the queſtion, and <hi>Attoe</hi> ſaid, that if the jury had found this feofment made to other feoffees, though the eſtate had agreed this ſhould be found againſt the Defendant; and <hi>Winch Iuſtice</hi> ſaid, that there was ſuch eſtate found as had taken away the execution or extent, and the eſtate for life is not material; but it was adjourned till another day.</p>

<pb n="33" facs="tcp:95435:21" rendition="simple:additions"/>
laid, becauſe he had not ſhewed where his councel deviſed that the fine ſhould be leavied.</p>
                  <p>In the caſe of a prohibition, in caſe of a libel in the Eccleſiaſtical Court for the tithes of Cattles, the Plantiff alleadged that thoſe Cattle, of which Tithes were demanded, are for his Dairy, and for the plough; and <hi>Winch</hi> being only preſent ſaid, that the parſon ſhall not have Tithes of ſuch Cattle, but if he bred up Cattle to ſell, it is otherwiſe; ſecondly, the Plantiff in the prohibition alleadged that time beyond memory the pariſhoners had paid a half peny for the Tithe of a Calf, and a penny for a Cow; and that upon a day limitted they uſe to bring this to the Church, and to pay this to the Vicar, and now the Vicar had libelled in the ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Court, againſt them to compel them to bring it home to his houſe; and <hi>Winch</hi> ſaid that this is no occaſion of a prohibition, for they agree in the <hi>modus,</hi> but vary in the place of payment, and this is not matter of ſubſtance, and for that rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon no prohibition will lie.</p>
                  <p>Vpon the reading of a record the caſe was, that the father made a feofment to the uſe of himſelf for life, the remainder to his ſon and his wife, and to the heires of the body of the ſon, and this was for a joynture for his wife, and the father di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the ſon alſo died, and whether this was a good joynture was the queſtion, for all this matter was pleaded in barre of dower brought by the wife, and it was ruled to be no good joynture for the feme, notwithſtanding that the father died in the life of his ſon, and <hi>Hutton</hi> ſaid, if a man made a feofment to the uſe of himſelf for life, the remainder to his Executors for years, the remainder to his wife for a joynture, this will be no good joynture within the Statute of joyntures, though the feme here had the immediate franktenement.</p>

Anne Buckley</hi> was Plantiff in a <hi>Quare Imp.</hi> againſt <hi>Simonds,</hi> and the caſe in effect was, that <hi>Andrew Buckley,</hi> Grandfather of the husband of the Plantiff, did Covenant by indenture with <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſton,</hi> that before ſuch a day his Son ſhould marry the daughter of <hi>Preſton.</hi> And Covenanted to convey <hi>6. l. 13.</hi> s. <hi>per Annum</hi> of rent iſſuing out of land, to hold to them during the life of the Covenanted and his wife, and after this he Covenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for him, his hetres, and aſſignes, that after the death of the Covenantor, and his wife the land to which the advowſon in queſtion is appendant ſhall remain, come, and be unto the ſaid ſon and his wife, and upon a demurrer the queſtion was, whether this Covenant did raiſe a preſent uſe to the Son, and to his wife, or whether this only reſts in Covenant, and <hi>Harris Serjeant</hi> argued, that no pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent uſe will ariſe by this Covenant, for firſt, all other Covenants in the inden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture are in the future, for the words are, that the lands ſhall remain and come &amp;c. and therefore till the death of the Covenantor the fee ſimple is in him, and no uſe will ariſe, for it ſhall be in the election of the Covenantor, what eſtate he will make to his Son, for he himſelf ſhall interpret his intent, and the difference in our

books is, when the words are in the preſent tenſe, and when in the future, and for this he cited <hi>22. H. 7.</hi> by <hi>Iuſtice Rede,</hi> if a man Covenant that land ſhall diſcend, remain, or revert, he ſaid this did not give any preſent intereſt, becauſe the wors are in the future, and it is in the election of the Covenantor, how, and in what manner the land ſhall paſs; and there he put the caſe, that if I give my horſe, or my Cow to <hi>I. S.</hi> there the Donee had election to take at his pleaſure the one or the other, becauſe the words are in the preſent tenſe, but if the words are, that I will give a horſe, or a Cow, there the Donor had election which he ſhall have, becauſe the words are in the future: the <hi>Lord Borroughs</hi> Covenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <hi>34. H. 8. Dyer 55.</hi> with another in frank marriage with his ſon, that immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly after his death, his ſon ſhall enjoy the uſe of his land of inheritance, according to the courſe as then they ſtood; and the queſtion was, whether the ſee ſimple was preſently out of the Covenantor; and the opinion was that it was not, becauſe it was but a Covenant, and did not change the fee ſimple, and ſo is <hi>Dyer 96. Sir Thomas Seymor</hi> promiſed, and Covenanted by indenture in conſideration, that the Covenantee had granted land to him, that he would leavy a fine to <hi>Wimbiſh</hi> and <hi>Pennoy</hi> of other lands, which fine ſhould be to <hi>Sir Thomas Seymor</hi> for life, the remainder to the Covenantee in taile, and no fine was levied, and the queſtion was, whether any uſe was raiſed by this Covenant to the Covenantee, and the opinion of the book is, that not, becauſe it is in the future, and he cited the 20. <hi>H.</hi> 7. 10. the Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi> in conſideration, that the <hi>Lord Henry</hi> his brother was to marry the <hi>Lady Wiltſhire,</hi> he Covenanted with <hi>Bray,</hi> and with others, that the Mannors of <hi>D.</hi> and of <hi>S.</hi> ſhall be to the Lady and to her heirs of her body begotten by the ſaid Lord, and after the Duke granted to the <hi>Lord Henry</hi> and his wife for their lives: and it was argued whether this ſecond grant is good or no, for if it is, then the firſt Covenant will not work to raiſe an uſe to the feme, and the book left that as a quere; and if it be, then he argued that in the principal caſe no preſent uſe is raiſed, but that this reſts meerly in Covenant, and ſo he prayed judgement for the Plantiff.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Serjeant Hendon</hi> to the contrary, for he thought this will raiſe a preſent uſe, and that this was the intent of the parties, that this ſhould raiſe a preſent uſe, for the intent was to advance them firſt, during their lives with the rent, and after the death of the Covenantor and his wife with the land it ſelf, and therefore of neceſſity this will raiſe a preſent uſe, for a bare action of Covenant may not be any advancement at all; and the rather here, becauſe they who take benefit of this are ſtrangers to the Covenant, and not <hi>Preſton</hi> himſelf, for as it appears by 3. <hi>H.</hi> 7. a ſtranger ſhall not take benefit by a Covenant; and therefore he ſaid the intentions of the parties was to raiſe an uſe, for otherwiſe there ſhall be no advancement at all.</p>
                  <p>And further the words in the indenture are Covenant and grant, and if no uſe is raiſed, then this word grant is idle, and every word ſhall be ſo expounded that they may take effect, and the word Covenant is inſufficient of it ſelf to paſs an eſtate in land, or to have any eſtate in ſignification other then to a meer Covenant, and to be obligatory: as is put <hi>Co.</hi> 2. <hi>Cromwels caſe, Tirrels caſe,</hi> there vouched, a leaſe for years provided, and it is Covenan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="38" facs="tcp:95435:24"/>
not good, for by his own ſhewing this acre of land is not parcel of the Mannor, for by the diſſolution of the Monaſtery by the death of all the Monks, the land ſhall go to the founders and donors, and not to eſcheat to the Lord of which that is hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, as appears 2. <hi>H.</hi> 6. 7. and 5. <hi>H.</hi> 7. if an annuity or rent be granted to an Abbot in fee, and the Abbot and all his Monks do die, the annuity or the rent is extinct, and ſhall not eſcheat: ſee the <hi>Deane of Norwiches caſe Coo.</hi> 3. agreed, that by the death of the Abbot and his Covent the corporation is diſſolved, and then the poſſeſſion ſhall go to the founders, and ſhall not eſcheat to the Lord of the Mannor of which the Land was holden, and he ſaid that this point is proved cleerly by the Statute, of the 27. <hi>H.</hi> 8. and 31. <hi>H.</hi> 8. of Monaſteries, in which Statutes there is an expreſs ſaving to all perſons, except to the donors and to their heires; and no mention is made of the ſaving of the right of thoſe of whom the land was holden; and that proves cleerly, that if the makers of the Statute had thought that the land had eſcheated to the Lords, they would have excepted them in the ſaving of the act, as they had excepted the Donors and Founders, for if otherwiſe the lands, and poſſeſſions ſhall eſcheat to the Lords of which the land was holden, they are within the ſaving of the Statute: and then it will follow that after the death of all the Monks, as at this day, that the Lords ſhall have the land by eſcheat, which the Sages of the Law never dreamt of who made that Statute, that any thing may accrew to the Lord, and therefore they provided only for the title of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors and Founders, which is an argument that they thought, that upon the diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of the Moneſteries, that the lands ſhall go to the Founders, and the ſame he thought concerning a corporation at this day, as of <hi>Suttons Hoſpital &amp;c.</hi> and ſo he concluded that, becauſe in the barre of the Defendant he claimed to hold from the Lord, to whom he ſuppoſed the land to eſcheat, and did not claim &amp;c. by his own ſhewing the barre is not good: and though our replication, and traverſe is not good, yet the Plantiff ſhall have judgement.</p>
                  <p>But admitting that the barre is good, yet the replication and traverſe is good, and then judgement ſhall be given for the Plantiff: and the caſe is, the Defendant pleaded a feofment of the <hi>Man.</hi> 12. <hi>Eliz.</hi> to <hi>Wright</hi> after that he had ſhewed the eſcheat of an acre, the Plantiff replied that the 10th. <hi>Eliz.</hi> the Feofor infeoffed <hi>C.</hi> of the acre of land, <hi>abſque hoc</hi> that he was infeoffed of the Mannor of which the acre is parcel, and <hi>Attoe</hi> argued, that the traverſe is good, and he alleadged 38. <hi>H.</hi> 6. 49. the ſame traverſe, and here when the Defendant had pleaded that the acre eſcheated, and had alleadged a Feofment of the Mannor, and had not expreſly alleadged a Feofment of the acre, the Plantiff may traverſe that which is not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly alleadged, becauſe this deſtroyes the very title of the Defendant; and he cited for that 34. <hi>H.</hi> 6. 15. a writ of priviledge in treſpaſs, as a Servant to an auditor of the exchequer, the Plantiff replied that he was ſervant to him in hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandry, <hi>abſque hoc</hi> that he was his ſervant to waite and attend upon him in his office, and it was holden a good traverſe, and yet that was not expreſly alleadged by the Defendant.</p>

                  <p>ANd now at this day the caſe of <hi>Auditor Curle</hi> was moved again in arreſt of judgement, by <hi>Hendon,</hi> and he ſaid <hi>Auditor Curle</hi> brought an action upon the caſe againſt <hi>Tuck,</hi> and he ſhewed in his declaration the erection of the Court of Wards, by the Statute of 32. <hi>H.</hi> 8. and that it was ordained by the ſame Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute, that thoſe perſons which ſhall be ordained <hi>Auditors</hi> of the ſame Court, ſhall be ſworn and take an oath, and that ſuch a time the Plantiff was ſworn an <hi>Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,</hi> and that to the office was 2. s. due to be paid for the ingroſſing of Feodaries, and that the ſaid Plantiff exerciſed the ſaid office honeſtly, and juſtly, and with the fees and the profits of the ſame he maintained his family, and that the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant ſuch a day, and at ſuch a place having Communication with the Plantiff con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning his behaviour in his office, ſaid to him, you have received money for the engroſſing of Feodaries, and I will prove that to be Couſenage, and <hi>tunc et ibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem</hi> ſaid you are a Couzner, and live by Couzning; and <hi>Hendon</hi> after verdict, for the Plantiff moved in arreſt of judgement, firſt, he ſaid the office appertains to 2. <hi>Auditors,</hi> as appears by the Statute of 32. <hi>H.</hi> 8. and by <hi>Auditor Curles caſe,</hi> and if that appertain to 2. then this doth not appertain to the Plantiff alone, and ſecondly, the Plantiff had expreſly laid in his declaration what fees are due to the office for the engroſſing of Feodaries, and then when it appears by his own ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the fees were due, and that the Defendant ſaid of him, that he took mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney for the engroſſing of Feodaries, this may not be any ſcandall to him, and he cited <hi>Suaggs caſe, Coo.</hi> 4. where the Plantiff ſhewed that his wife was living, and that the Defendant ſaid of him, that he had killed his wife, here in this wiſe no action lies, for it appears by his own ſhewing, that the wife was alive, and ſo no ſcandal, and ſo in our caſe, when he had ſhewed that ſuch fees were due for the engroſſing of Feodaries, it was no ſcandal to him, for the Defendant to ſay, that he took money for the ingroſſing of them, and thereby the words are general of Couznage, and they may have other interpretation as the Couzning at the Cock pits, or the like, and then thoſe general words ſhall not be applied to his office, and not left to ſuch an expoſition as is equivocal, and he vouched <hi>Serjeant Heales</hi> caſe, <hi>Mr. Heales</hi> Warrants have undone many a man, and adjudged that an acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion lies, becauſe it had relation to his profeſſion, but he ſaid that this was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards reverſed in the Exchequer chamber, becauſe the word Warrants is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, and may be applied to other things: but <hi>Winch</hi> interrupted him, and ſaid that it was not reverſed for error, &amp; then <hi>Hendon</hi> alleadged <hi>Yardleyes caſe</hi> 11. <hi>Jac. in C.

                     <hi>Attoe Serjeant</hi> to the ſame purpoſe, but his only argument was, becauſe the Plantiff had alleadged that the fees were due to him, and ſo no ſcandal according to <hi>Snags caſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But it was reſolved by <hi>Hobert</hi> and <hi>Winch</hi> being only preſent, for <hi>Hutton</hi> was in the Chancery, and <hi>Iones</hi> was not yet returned from <hi>Ireland;</hi> that the Plantiff ſhall have judgement, and firſt it was agreed by them and by <hi>Hutton</hi> the day before, that <hi>tunc et ibidem</hi> ſhall have relation to the ſame time that the firſt words were ſpoken, and ſecondly, by <hi>Hobert</hi> and <hi>Winch</hi> though the office ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertaines to 2. yet this is a ſcandal to him, for the ſcandal is to the perſon, and not to the office, and the perſons are diſtinct and ſeveral, though the office is joynt, and they may not joyn in an action, for of the other no words are ſpoken, and ſo they agreed that this objection is of no force, and as to the other objection which was made by <hi>Hendon,</hi> and by <hi>Attoe, Hobert</hi> ſaid that true it is as had been ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, but he ſaid for his part he never was, nor yet is ſatisfied in the Law of that caſe, for be ſhe in life or not, yet the ſcandal is the ſame to the ſtanders by, who per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance did not know that ſhe was living, and ſo the ſcandal never the leſs: but admitting the caſe to be good Law, yet our caſe differs from the reaſon of that, for in our caſe he had ſhewed that 2. s. fees were due to him for the ingroſſing of Feo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daries, and the Defendant ſaid, that he took money for the ingroſſing of Feoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries which is Couzning, and ſo ſhall be intended that he took more then was due, and this is extortion; and as to <hi>Eliots</hi> and <hi>Browns</hi> caſe he agreed, that to ſay he had made falſe writings no action will lie, for it is no ſcandal to him in his profeſſion, for it doth not appertaine to an Attorney, to make writings, no more then it appertaines to an Appothecary to give Phyſick, and ſo it is no ſcandal to him in his profeſſion: and he agreed the caſe of <hi>Mallard</hi> againſt <hi>Wiſe,</hi> he forged my husbands Will, no action will lie, for the words are repugnant and contrary, for if it be forged, it is not the Will of her husband, but in our caſe the words had a plaine ſence to common underſtanding, and ſhall be intended to refer to his office, for if he had ſaid that he took money for ingroſſing of Feodaries, which is deſceit without queſtion, that had been actionable, but there may not be Couzning with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out deſceit.</p>
                  <p>And he cited <hi>Boxes caſe,</hi> where one ſaid of an Attorney, that he was a maintainer of ſuits, and a Champerter, action lies, for it ſhall be taken to be a ſcandal to him in his profeſſion, for though an Attorney may maintain ſuites, yet he ought not to be a Champerter, and he further ſaid, that he who will maintain an action for words ought to be ſcandalized in his publick profeſſion, and he cited a caſe which was in the <hi>Kings Bench, Brad againſt Hay,</hi> and the Plantiff declared, that he was Bailiff to ſuch a one, and that he had the buying and the ſelling of his Corn, and that the Defendant ſaid of him, that he ſold by falſe meaſures, and adjudged that no action lies, for it is not a ſcandal to him in his publick profeſſion, and ſo 36. <hi>Eliz.</hi> one ſaid of a Merchant that he kept a falſe debt book, and becauſe he may be a Merchant without a debt book, it was ruled that an action doth not lie, but if he had ſaid of him that he deceived men by buying and ſelling, theſe words had been actionable, and he ſaid that two things are required to every publick profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſcience, and fidelity, and when a man who hath a publick profeſſion is ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lized, in either of thoſe an action of the caſe lies, and cited <hi>Palmers caſe of Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colns Inne,</hi> he being a Lawyer 'twas ſaid to him by one, that he had as much Law as a <hi>Iackan-apes,</hi> and adjudged to be actionable, for it is a ſcandal to him in his profeſſion, and ſo <hi>Sir Miles Fleetwoods caſe,</hi> where he who is Plantiff in this action was Defendant in that, he being receiver of the Court of Wards, one ſaid to him, Mr. deceiver hath Couzned the King, and hath dealt falſly with him, and adjudged that an action upon the caſe lies, and yet he did not ſhew, wherein he had Couzned him or dealt deceitfully with him, but yet becauſe it appears to the Court that he might deal deceitfully, and Couzen the King, therefore actionable, and he cited <hi>Birchleys caſe,</hi> you have dealt corruptly, an action lies, and yet he
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:95435:26" rendition="simple:additions"/>
did not ſhew wherein he had dealt corruptly, and here he had ſaid he was a Couz<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ner by the receipt of money, which is an expreſs ſcandal to him in his office. <hi>Winch</hi> accordingly to every office of truſt is a condition in Law annexed, that he deal honeſtly and juſtly, and he cited <hi>Wingates caſe</hi> in the Kings Bench, one ſaid to another, is <hi>Wingate</hi> your Attorney, and the other ſaid that he was, and the other replied, take heed and follow him well, for elſe he will make you throw your purſe over your boſome; and it was adjudged that an action lies, for it is a ſcandal to him in his profeſſion, and it ſhall be taken as much as if he had ſaid, he will make you ſpend all the money in your purſe, if you look not the better to him, and ſo applied this to the principal caſe: and in this caſe judgement was commanded to be entered for the Plantiff in the action, if no other cauſe be ſhewed before ſuch a day.</p>
                  <p>An action upon the caſe was brought for theſe words, the Plantiff did load a ſhip of my Fathers with Barley, and did ſteal, and Couzned 7. quarters thereof in meaſure, and upon not guilty pleaded it was found for the Plantiff, and now it was moved in arreſt of judgement, that the word Cozned being joyned with the word ſtole, had taken away the force of that, and made it but Cozning, but <hi>Hutton</hi> contrary, and that it ſhall be underſtood, that he ſtole 7. quarters in meaſure, and quantity, and <hi>Winch</hi> ſeemed to agree, and it was adjourned: and an other day awarded that an action lies.</p>

for yeares by indenture, and then leavied a fine, and died, and then the Mother being Tenant in tail, and joyntreſs within the Statute of 11. <hi>H.</hi> 7. as in our caſe ſhe is, and ſhe ſuffers a recovery, and vouches the daughters in reverſion, and leſſee for years enters after the death of the feme, by force of 11. <hi>H.</hi> 7. for leſſee for years is a perſon who may enter within the expreſs words of that Statute, which gives entrie to any perſon who hath an intereſt, and ſee for that <hi>Coo.</hi> 3. <hi>Lincoln Colledge</hi> caſe, and <hi>Dyer</hi> 148.

                     <hi>Hendon Serjeant</hi> to the contrary, and he divided the caſe in three points. Firſt, when Tenant in tail had iſſue a ſon, and a daughter or two ſons, and the eldeſt ſon in the life of his father, who is Tenant in tail levies a fine, and dies without iſſue, whether this ſhall binde the youngeſt ſon, and he thought that it ſhould not, and yet he agreed, that an eſtate tail may be barred by a fine, though he who leauied the fine was not ſeiſed at the time of the eſtate tail, and this by the very words of the Statute, of the 32. <hi>H.</hi> 8. ſee the caſe of fines <hi>Coo.</hi> 3, and <hi>Grants</hi> caſe vouched, <hi>Lampets caſe,</hi> and ſo is the caſe of <hi>Hunt</hi> and <hi>King</hi> 37. <hi>Eliz.</hi> cited by my brother <hi>Harvey,</hi> and ſo he agreed cleerly, if the ſon who leavies the fine, ſurvives the father who was Tenant in tail, that then in this caſe this binds the eſtate tail for ever: and the reaſon is upon the very words of the Statute, of 32. <hi>H.</hi> 8. or any was intailed to the Anceſtor of the iſſue in tail, and in this caſe, when the iſſue doth ſurvive the Anceſtor, and dies, this ſhall binde the iſſue, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was intailed to him who leavied the fine who was his Anceſtor, for he may not make any Conveyance to the eſtate tail, except he make mention of him, who leavied the fine, becauſe that he ſurvived the father who was Tenant in tail, but when he who leavies the fine dies in the life of his father, <hi>viz.</hi> the eldeſt ſon, then the youngeſt ſon may convey an eſtate taile to him without making mention of his eldeſt brother: and this appears by the 46. <hi>E.</hi> 3. 9. 4. <hi>H.</hi> 6. 10. 11. <hi>H.</hi> 7. 6. ſee the caſe of <hi>Buckner Coo.</hi> 8. from which caſes he inferred, that if the youngeſt bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther may have an action at the Common Law, without making mention of his eldeſt brother, then ſuch a conſtruction ſhall be made of this word Anceſtor, in the Statute of 32. <hi>H.</hi> 8. that it ſhall be taken for ſuch an Anceſtor, by whom the iſſue in tail claimes, and for no other Anceſtor, and for this he put the caſe, if land be given to a man and to his heirs, females begotten of his body, and he had iſſue a ſon, and a daughter, and the ſon leavied a fine, and died, this ſhall barre the eſtate tail for the cauſe aforeſaid, and for authorities in this kinde he cited the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports of <hi>Dalliſon</hi> of—<hi>Eliz.</hi> printed at the end of <hi>Aſhles Tables in Stamfords</hi>
                     <pb n="43" facs="tcp:95435:27"/>
caſe in the end of the ſame caſe, where the very difference is agreed,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Mich. 29.</hi> Jac. C. P.</note> where the eldeſt ſon dies in the life of the father, and where not: and <hi>Hobert</hi> demanded of him by what warrant thoſe reports of <hi>Dalliſon</hi> came in print.</p>
                  <p>And then <hi>Hendon</hi> cited the opinion of ſome of the judges, in the caſe of <hi>Zouch and Banfield:</hi> and ſee <hi>Coo.</hi> 3. the caſe of fines according to this difference: and he ſaid, that <hi>Sir George Browns caſe</hi> will warrant that in the very letter of it, for there it is ſaid, that no iſſue inheritable by force of the tail may enter after the fine, by which he inferred, that if he is ſuch an iſſue that is not inheritable, he is out of the Statute, and ſo he concluded the firſt point, that the fine being leavied by the eldeſt ſon, in the life of his Mother, that ſhall not barre the eſtate tail. Secondly, he argued that as this caſe is, the feme is not within the Statute, of the 11 <hi>H.</hi> 7. becauſe that at the time when ſhe ſuffered a recovery, ſhe was ſeiſed of an eſtate, in general tail by force of the remainder which was limitted to her and her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, and to the heirs of their two bodies ingendred, which took effect in the feme, at the time of the death of the husband; and this being an eſtate in tail of the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe of the huband which took effect in remainder, this may not be a joynture within the Statute of of the 27. <hi>H.</hi> 8. and then if ſhe be not a joyntereſs with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in that Statute though this eſtate was of the purchaſe, and of the acquiſition of her husband, yet this is out of the danger of the Statute, of the 11. <hi>H.</hi> 7. for the words are, any woman who had any eſtate in dower, or in tail joynt with her husband of the purchaſe, and of the acquiſition of the husband: which words of the purchaſe of the husband had relation to Tenant in dower, or to a woman who was a joyntreſs, and was not the intent of the Statute, to make ſuch a remainder to be within the danger of the Statute, when the husband himſelf in his life may dock this by a recovery, and therefore it is not within the Statute.</p>
                  <p>And as to the Third point he argued, that admitting that ſhe was a joyntreſs, within the Statute of the 27. <hi>H.</hi> 8. yet when the feme ſuffers a recovery with the aſſent of him in remainder in fee, this recovery is out of the body of the Statute, of 11. <hi>H.</hi> 7. any which ſhall diſcontinue, or releaſe with warranty, and that all ſuch recoveryes ſhall be void, and ſhall be taken for fained recoveries, and this may not be imagined a fained recovery, where he in remainder in tail is vouched by him who is Tenant for life, <hi>Jennings caſe Coo.</hi> 10. and ſuch recovery, as is there reſolved, is out of the Statute of the 14. <hi>Eliz.</hi> and is good by the Common Law, and ſo in our caſe, but admitting this to be within the Statute of the 11. of <hi>H.</hi> 7. yet the proviſo of the ſame Statute had made that good, for there is an expreſs proviſo, that a recovery with the aſſent of the heir inheritable, if this appear upon Record this ſhall not be within the Statute, and in our caſe, this is with the aſſent of the heir inheritable, and alſo this appears to be of record, and ſo the reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very is out of the danger of the Statute, of the 11. <hi>H.</hi> 7. <hi>See Doctor and Student,</hi> a book which was written but a litle time after the making of this Statute, and <hi>Dyer</hi> 89. <hi>Vernons caſe,</hi> and he ſaid that the intent of the ſame Statute, and of the proviſo of the ſame Statute was to have iſſues and heirs, and not termors, who had only a future intereſt to falſifie recoveries, and ſo he concluded that the recove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry is out of the ſame Statute, and that the proviſo of the ſame Statute had made that good, by the aſſent of the heir, but admitting, this ſhould be againſt him, that this recovery ſhall be within the Statute, yet the leſſee in our caſe ſhall not falſifie, nor take advantage of the forfeiture by force of the ſame Statute, but it hath been objected by <hi>Harvy,</hi> that the wife in this caſe had only an eſtate for life, or Tenant in tail after poſſibility of iſſue extinct, and he anſwered that the reſolution in <hi>Bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounts caſe Coo.</hi> 119. is contrary, for it is there expreſly agreed, that ſhe was Tenant in tail after the fine leavied by the iſſue, and ſo was it alſo reſolved in <hi>Pophams caſe</hi> 9. <hi>Eliz.</hi> but there it was doubted whether ſhe was Tenant in tail, within the 32. <hi>H.</hi> 8. who might make a leaſe, but all agreed that ſhe was Tenant in tail, who may ſuffer a recovery, and binde the remainder: and then when the feme ſuffers ſuch a recovery as in our caſe, that recovery ſhall take away a term

                     <hi>Hendon</hi> to the contrary; and yet for the firſt point he agreed, that a preſcription to pay Tithes to the Vicar was good, for here it appeares, that the Vicarage is as antient as the Parſonage, both being time beyond memory; and it was the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion of all this Court when the caſe was firſt opened, and ſo he ſaid, he would not inſiſt upon that, but agree the Law to be againſt him, but then for the ſecond point, he held the <hi>modus</hi> to be gone by the diſparking, for the preſcription is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed to the Park, and not to the land, for the preſcription is to pay a Buck and a Doe for all manner of Tiths of that Park, and then the preſcription is in ſome ſort annexed to that meerly as land, but <hi>quatenus</hi> a Park, and for this he held, if a man will preſcribe to pay 10. s. for the Tithes of ſuch land, and it is given in evidence to be a Park, this will not maintain the iſſue, for a Park is deceivable one way or other, and ſo are of ſeveral natures, and ſo <hi>Coo.</hi> 4. <hi>Lutterels caſe,</hi> a tenure to cover the hall of the Lord, if the hall is thrown down the tenure is gone, and here when the Park is deſtroyed, the <hi>modus</hi> is alſo deſtroyed, but it hath been ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected here, that the preſcription is general, and therefore though the Park was diſparked, yet the <hi>modus</hi> had continued, to this he anſwered, that this preſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſhall have ſuch conſtruction as a grant ſhall have, and though it is general, yet it is <hi>ſub modo</hi> ſubject to this limitation, that this alwayes continue and remain a Park, and it was reſolved 43. <hi>Eliz.</hi> that the Commoner may not grant over his Common, except he grant over his Tenement, for they may not be ſevered, and ſo indeed is <hi>Nevils caſe</hi> in the Commentaries: a man preſcribed to have eſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers to burn in his houſe, if the owner deſtroy the houſe the eſtovers are gone, for the preſcription is annexed to the houſe, and ſo in our caſe the preſcription is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed to the Park, and not to the land, for 18. <hi>H.</hi> 6. 21. a Park may not be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the grant of the King, and the Common Law ſaith, if a man preſcribe to have Tithes in a Vineyard, if the Vineyard be converted to another uſe, the Tithes are gone, for it is ſaid <hi>tantum eſt preſcriptio, quantum eſt poſſeſſio,</hi> and vouched <hi>Coneys caſe,</hi> 14. <hi>Caro.</hi> who preſcribed to be diſcharged of paying Tithes for a meadow, and afterwards this was converted to arrable, and the opinion of the Court was, that the preſcription is gone, and the rather in our caſe, becauſe it is by the act of the party himſelf that the Park is deſtroyed, &amp; yet he agreed the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal caſe in <hi>Lutterels caſe, Coo.</hi> 4. for there a new will is only a tranſlation of the old, and no deſtruction of the thing which was before: but in our caſe the Park it ſelf is deſtroyed by the act of the party himſelf, and therefore the preſcription which was annexed to this is gone forever.</p>
                  <p>Alſo this preſcription is againſt Common right, and therefore ſhall be taken ſtrictly, as <hi>Teringhams caſe Coo.</hi> 4. a man had Common appurtenant in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mans land; and he purchaſed parcel of the ſame land, the Common is gone, becauſe this Common is againſt Common right, but otherwiſe of a Common ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendant, and he cited <hi>Wilds caſe Coo.</hi> 8. according to our caſe, that a preſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to pay a Buck, and a Doe for the Tithes of a Park is againſt Common right, for though Tithes are not due <hi>Iure divino;</hi> yet they are due <hi>jure humano &amp; Communi;</hi> and therefore the preſcription is not founded in Law, and it ſhall not be intended to the Park, when that is deſtroyed and converted to arrable, as if a man made a feofment of land with warranty, and afterwards the land is impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved and made of greater value, then that was at the time of the feofment; if in this

Aſſiſes: and alſo he held if Tenant in taile lets parcel of a Mannor for life, that were the reverſion of this parcel, is not parcel of the Mannor for the cauſe aforeſaid; and ſo in our caſe, when the Biſhop granted parcel which is not grantable by the Statute, now he had diſcontinued the reverſion, and had gained a new fee ſimple which may not be parcel of the Mannor, ſo long as this new fee ſimple had a continuance, and this was his firſt reaſon.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="47" facs="tcp:95435:29" rendition="simple:additions"/>And ſecondly, he argued from the intent of the parties, becauſe the intent was, that the leaſe to <hi>Wood</hi> ſhall be good, and if the reverſion of the 20. acres paſs to <hi>Wood,</hi> this will make all the leaſe void, for no rent may be reſerved out of the reverſion, but out of the land it ſelf, 3. Aſſiſe <hi>Placito ultimo,</hi> a Biſhop let land, and a hundred, rendring rent, the rent iſſues out of the land, and not out of the hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, and ſo here it iſſues out of the land, and not out of the reverſion, which made the leaſe all void; and ſo he concluded the firſt point, that the reverſion of the 20. acres did not paſs to <hi>Wood</hi> the leſſee of the Mannors.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, when the Biſhop lets 20. acres of ground rendring rent, and this is not confirmed by the Dean and Chapter as it ought, and after he lets the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, and the ſucceſſor accepts the rent of the Mannor, this acceptance ſhall not make the leaſe of the 20. acres to be good, admitting that the reverſion do paſs; and when the Biſhop had made a leaſe for 3. lives he may not contract for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, and when a leaſe is meerly void in the creation, there no acceptance after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards may make that good; but admitting this to be againſt him, yet the leſſee ſhall not have the Herriot, for they are not appendant to the reverſion, but due on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by way of Covenant; and the words are yielding &amp;c. and this being a Colla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teral thing, it ſhall not go with the reverſion; and the Herriot here may not be had without it be delivered by the leſſee for life. Secondly, it is paid only in the name of a Herriot, and this is not Herriot ſervice. Thirdly, it is to be paid upon the death of a ſtranger, and not upon the death of the leſſee, and all this proves this Herriot to be collateral; and he cited <hi>Rawlins caſe,</hi> a leaſe for years paying for a fine 20. l. this is a ſumme in groſs, and ſhall not paſs with the reverſion; and ſo he prayed judgement for the Plantiff.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Attoe</hi> contrary; and yet he agreed the caſe of the husband and wife, and of the Tenant in tail, for here the leſſor gaines a new fee ſimple, but in our caſe, when the Biſhop lets for life, this is not any wrong, for the ſucceſſor may enter, and he ſhall have this leaſe not in his natural capacity, but alwayes in his politique capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and for that there is an apparent difference between the caſes; and for that reaſon, he held that the reverſion was parcel of the Mannor, and ſo paſſed to the leſſee, and as to that which had been ſaid, that the intent of the parties was only, that the Mannor in poſſeſſion, and not the parcel in reverſion ſhould paſs to the leſſee, for that is moſt beneficial to the leſſor, to this he anſwered that by expreſs words this is granted, and no conſtruction ſhall be made contrary to the very ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs words of the grant, and here though the Defendant had not any title at all to the Herriot, yet the Plantiff ſhall not have a trover and converſion for this, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that he himſelf had not right to this, and for that reaſon judgement ſhall be given for the Defendant; and he alſo argued, that the leaſe of the reverſion is not meerly void, but voidable, and then the acceptance extends to this: ſee 37. <hi>H.</hi> 6. the leaſe of a Pri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

I may retain the horſe till the money is paid, for till then the contract is not compleat; and ſo in this caſe, and here the Plantiff ſhall have an action of accompt upon this delivery, and if he ſell them otherwiſe, or do not ſell them for ready money, he had gone beyond his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, and this Cuſtome is unreaſonable, that the Bill ſhall be taken in his name who ſold the goods, but perchance if the cuſtome had been alleadged, to take the Bill in the name of the owner of the goods, this had been good; but in our caſe the owner of the goods may not ſue, nor have any remedy for his goods, except the factor will go into Spain and ſue the ſaid Bill, and it is unreaſonable to leave this to the pleaſure of my factor, whether I ſhall have any remedy for my goods ſold, and it is very unreaſonable that I ſhall be paid with a Bill which may not be ſued, and here the Plantiff is a ſtranger to the Cuſtome of <hi>Spain,</hi> and ſhall not be bound by that.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Serjeant Harris</hi> to the contrary: the Cuſtome which is alledged is good among Merchants, though it is not good according to our Common Law, and ſo if two Merchants trade joyntly, and one of them dies before ſeverance of the goods, yet his executor ſhall have his part, and not the Survivor, and ſo by the law of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants a man cannot wage his law in debt upon a ſimple contract; by which it is apparant that the laws of Merchants differ from our laws, and indeed the laws of Merchants are National laws: and that this is the Cuſtome in <hi>Spain</hi> is confeſſed by the demurrer, and then we may not examine that by the reaſon of our laws, and the laws of Merchants ought to be favoured for trading ſake, which is the life of every Kingdome; and by the law of Merchants a Bill without ſeal is good, and yet by our law it is but an eſcrowl: and ſo I pray judgement for the Defendant. <hi>Hobert chief Iuſtice,</hi> when the Merchant had delivered goods to the factor to ſell,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:95435:32" rendition="simple:additions"/>
he had made the factor <hi>negotiator geſtorum:</hi> and for that reaſon the factor may ſell the goods without ready money, and this is good reaſon, for perchance the goods are of that nature that they will not keep without periſhing, by which clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it appears, that if I deliver goods to another to Merchandiſe, and to ſell, he may ſell them without ready money, but if my factor or Bailiff will ſell them to one which he knows w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

Rot.</hi> 921. between <hi>Whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood</hi> and <hi>Cordery</hi> and his wife Defendants, which caſe and judgement was after affirmed in the Exchequer Chamber upon a writ of error, and the caſe was, that the Plantiff declared that the Defendants intending to take away his good name, did charge him to have raviſhed <hi>Dorothie Coxe,</hi> and maliciouſly exhibited a Bill of indictment, containing that the Plantiff did felloniouſly raviſh the ſaid <hi>Dorothie</hi> their daughter, and did give this in evidence to the Grand jury who found Ignoramus: and yet it was adjudged that an action lies, and he cited a caſe the 19. <hi>Iac. in B. R. Deney</hi> againſt <hi>Ridgy,</hi> where was—only an indictment pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred concerning the ſtealing of a horſe, and no more, and yet an action lies. <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert chief Iuſtice</hi> ſaid, that if ſeemed to him that it is actionable, for this is as great a ſcandal to give this in evidence to the Grand jury, as to publiſh this upon an Alebench: and as the courſe of Iuſtice ought not to be ſtopped, ſo neither ought the good, name of man in things which concern his life be taken away without good cauſe, and I have heard that judgement was given another Term for the Plantiff, but quere better of that.</p>

Firſt, whether this limitation is good. Secondly, whether the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſe is good, and it was argued by <hi>Richardſon Serjeant,</hi> that this limitation of the Statute by way of deviſee is good, and he vouched <hi>Dyer</hi> 330. <hi>Clarks caſe,</hi> and 4. <hi>Eliz. Goldley and Buckleys caſe,</hi> a man deviſed to his ſon and his heirs, provided that if his perſonal eſtate did not ſuffice to pay his debts and legacies, that then his lands ſhall be to another, and he vouched <hi>Brown and Pells caſe,</hi> which
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:95435:33"/>
was adjudged in <hi>Banco Regis,</hi> the caſe was, that a man had two ſons, <hi>William</hi> the eldeſt, and <hi>Thomas</hi> the youngeſt, and he deviſed his lands to <hi>Thomas</hi> his ſon and his heirs, provided that if <hi>Thomas</hi> died without iſſue living, that then <hi>Willi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am</hi> ſhall have the land, and it was reſolved that this was good to <hi>William</hi> by way of executory deviſe, and in that caſe doubt was moved whether if <hi>Thomas</hi> ſuffer a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery, whether this ſhall take away the eſtate of <hi>William;</hi> and it was holden by all the Court, except <hi>Doderidg,</hi> that it ſhall not, but all agreed that this deviſe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the future contingency is good, and ſo he concluded, that if the youngeſt ſon die in the life of the Mother, and before the legacies are paid, the land ſhall remain to the Plantiff, according to the intent of the deviſor: but the other doubt is, when the Plantiff did releaſe all his right, and claim to the other, whether this releaſe will extinguiſh this future poſſibility; and he held that it will not: and he ſaid that he had ſeen the caſe of <hi>Lampet Coo.</hi> 10. and there the releaſe of a poſſibility is penned as in our caſe, and if any word diſcharge this poſſibility, it is this word right, but if the reſolution of that book had not been againſt him, he would have argued that this right was not ſufficient to extinguiſh this future poſſibility, but that there ought to be a more apt and proper word, but he ſaid he would not ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue againſt books: but he ſaid that which he would inſiſt upon was the diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of poſſibilities, for there are two manner of poſſibilities, the one is Common and ordinary, the other is more remote and forreigne. And firſt, there is a poſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity which is Common and neceſſary, and this depends upon an ordinary caſualty, as a leaſe for life, the remainder to the right heirs of <hi>I. S.</hi> for it is apparant that the right heirs of <hi>I. S.</hi> may take by this, and ſuch a poſſibility may be releaſed: and a poſſibility which is remote and forreigne is, as if a leaſe be made for life, the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to another during the life of the leſſee for life, or a leaſe for life, the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to the Corporation of <hi>B.</hi> thoſe remainders are void: but yet by poſſibility they may be good, for in the firſt caſe the Tenant for life may enter into religion: and in the latter caſe the King may make Corporations, and yet becauſe ſuch poſſibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties are not uſual, the remainders are void: ſee <hi>Coo.</hi> 2. <hi>Chamleys caſe,</hi> where ſuch a remote poſſibility may not be releaſed, if a man give land to one which is married, and to another woman which is married, and to the heirs of their two bodies ingen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, this is a good eſtate tail, for there is a common poſſibility that they may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termarry, but if the gift be to a man and to two women who are married, and to the heirs of their bodies ingendred, they ſhall not have an eſtate tail executed, for it is a remote and forreigne poſſibility, and an imbrodery of eſtates which the law will not allow, nor reſpect: ſee the Rector of <hi>Chedingtons</hi> caſe, that ſuch a poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility as in our caſe may not be releaſed, for firſt here the mother ought to be dead before the Plantiff ſhall have land. Secondly, legacies ought to be paid. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>Thomas</hi> ought to be dead, and till all theſe poſſibilities hap, the Plantiff ſhall have nothing in the land, and for that it is a remote poſſibility which is not gone by the releaſe, for as it is ſaid, when a poſſibility ſhall be gone by a releaſe, there ought to be a good foundation upon which the releaſe may operate: ſecondly, the poſſibility which is releaſed ought to be neceſſary and Common, but in our caſe it is not neceſſary that the ſon ſhall enjoy it in the life of his mother: and alſo the mother may in a ſhort time pay the legacies, and then neither of the ſons ſhall have the land: by which circumſtances it is apparant, that this is not a Common or an ordinary poſſibility, but is a remote and forraigne expectancy, which ſhall not be gone by this releaſe, and this differs from <hi>Lampets</hi> caſe, for there was a poſſibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of a Chattel, which as it may eaſily be created, ſo it may eaſily be deſtroyed, but in our caſe it is a franktenement, which as that requires a greater ceremony in the creation, and for that it will require a greater matter to deſtroy, and to extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh that; and it is ſaid in <hi>Woods</hi> caſe cited in <hi>Shelleys</hi> caſe <hi>Coo.</hi> 1. that if a man covenant with <hi>A.</hi> that if <hi>I. S.</hi> infeoffed him of the Mannor of <hi>D.</hi> that then he will ſtand ſeiſed to the uſe of him and his heirs of the Mannor of <hi>B.</hi> and the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nantee died, and the ſaid <hi>I. S.</hi> infeoffed the Covenantor, in ſuch caſe the heir ſhall
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:95435:34"/>
be inward, and yet it is only a poſſibility which deſcends, which poſſibility of an uſe may not be diſcharged, or releaſed, and yet in that caſe there was a poſſibility which is more Common, and ordinary then in our caſe; for there was a poſſibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty that <hi>I. S.</hi> ſhould make the feofment, and ſo ſay a good foundation upon which the releaſe may operate: and he put the caſe that <hi>I.</hi> ſhall let for ſo many years as <hi>I. S.</hi> ſhall name, if <hi>I. S.</hi> name it is good, and yet he held if <hi>I. S.</hi> releaſe before the nomination that this releaſe is meerly void, becauſe he had only a poſſibility: and as to <hi>Digs caſe Coo.</hi> 1. there a power of Revocation may be releaſed, and good reaſon, for the Covenantor who releaſed had the bird in his own hand, and for that it was no remote poſſibility: but there it is ſaid, that if the power be limited to an eſtranger, there the ſtranger may not releaſe: and he alſo agreed <hi>Albanies</hi> caſe, for there the power to releaſe was upon the death of a man only, but in our caſe it is upon death, and other contingencies by which theſe remote poſſibilities ſhall not be releaſed. <hi>Hoes caſe Coo.</hi> 5. there a releaſe of all actions, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands to the Bailee made this void; and in the caſe of <hi>Brown</hi> and <hi>Pell</hi> which was remembred before, it was the opinion of all the Court againſt <hi>Judge Dode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridge,</hi> that where the deviſe was to the ſon in fee, and if he died without iſſue li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, that then his eldeſt brother ſhall have that, if in this caſe the ſecond ſon ſuffer a recovery, yet this had not deſtroyed the poſſibility which the eldeſt brother had to have the land, and if a common recovery which is matter of record, and the common aſſurance of the realm will not take away this poſſibility, <hi>a fortiori</hi> a releaſe which is but matter of fact, and ſo he concluded and prayed judgement for the Plantiff.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Bawtry</hi> to the contrary, and he ſaid, that if this remainder ſhall be good, then the inconvenience which the judges had alwayes endeavoured to take way ſhall be on foot again, as in the caſe of <hi>Chamley,</hi> and <hi>Corbets</hi> of ſpringing uſes, for if it ſhall be lawful for a man to limit a fee upon a Collateral condition or limitation, then there ſhall be a perpetuitie, and for this if any litteral conſtruction ſhall be made up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſuch conveyances, this will introduce dangerous events to inheritances, and for that he held that limitation to the Plantiff to be meerly void, for when the land is deviſed in fee, this deviſee by this had an abſolute eſtate in fee, and it ſhall be ſtrange to give this to another though this be by way of deviſe, for though the will of every man ſhall be ſupplied by the intent of the deviſor, yet his intent ought to ſtand with the rules of the law, and otherwiſe his intent ſhall revert, and for that he cited 29. <hi>H.</hi> 8. a man made two executors, provided that one of them ſhall not adminiſter, here the intent did plainly appear, and yet becauſe the intent is contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the power which the law gives to every executor, therefore it is void: and it is put for a bare rule in <hi>Corbets caſe,</hi> that ſuch a conveyance which a man may not make in his life time, by act executed, he may not make by his Will, but a man may not make ſuch a conveyance by act executed in his life time, for as it is ſaid in <hi>Colthirſts caſe,</hi> if a man let for life, the remainder for life, upon condition that if the firſt leſſee do ſuch a thing, that then the land ſhall remain over to a ſtranger, this remainder is void: for when the land is given before, this ſecond limitation is meerly void: and alſo the caſe is put, that if a man give lands in fee upon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, the remainder over this remainder is void; for the other had an eſtate in fee before, by which it is apparant, that when an eſtate is one time lawfully veſted in any certain perſon, there no limitation may give that to a ſtranger, by any act executed in his life at the common law, and then it ſhall not be good by way of deviſe 28. <hi>H.</hi> 8. <hi>Dyer,</hi> a term was deviſed for years, the remainder over: and it was adjudged by <hi>Baldwin,</hi> and by <hi>Shelley,</hi> that the remainder in that caſe is void, for when the deviſor had given his term, he may not limit this remainder over, though this be by way of deviſe: and this may be good law notwithſtanding <hi>Lampets caſe,</hi> for there the leaſe was deviſed and not the land, and for that reaſon may be a difference: and he vouched the caſe which was remembred by <hi>Richardſon</hi> 29. <hi>H.</hi> 8. 33. and then as to the ſecond point, he held that the releaſe was good, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:95435:34" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the firſt point to be againſt him, for if the eldeſt ſon had any right by this releaſe, then this word right in the releaſe will deſtroy and extinguiſh that, and this poſſibility is not remote and forraigne, for the condition or limitation is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed to the eſtate, and is not a ſubſequent condition which creates an eſtate, and this depends upon an ordinary caſualty which is common to all men, and the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of debts and of legacies, is incident and common to every executor; and as for <hi>Albanies caſe Coo.</hi> 1. the caſe was, that a man had a power to revoke uſes upon the death of a ſtranger without iſſue, and reſolved that this power may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſed, and yet his power depended upon two contingencies, death, and death without iſſue, and the caſe is alſo there put, if <hi>A.</hi> infeoffe <hi>B.</hi> upon condition, that if <hi>B.</hi> Survive <hi>C.</hi> and then if <hi>A.</hi> and his heirs pay to <hi>B.</hi> 10. l. that then he ſhall enter, in this caſe there are many contingencies involved in one conveyance, and yet it is there ſaid, that theſe contingencies may be releaſed; and in <hi>Lampets caſe Coo.</hi> 10. there are ſix reaſons, wherefore ſuch a contingencie may be releaſed, and our caſe is within all the reaſons which are there mentioned, for the words in the releaſe as have been remembred by my brother <hi>Richardſon,</hi> are all one with our caſe, and the firſt reaſon is, becauſe this is a Chattel, which as it may be eaſily created, ſo it may be eaſily deſtroyed, to this he gave anſwer, that this remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of a Term was an intereſt to him who releaſed: and ſo in our it is an intereſt of a remainder to the Plantiff, and for that the releaſe is good. Secondly, it is a <hi>maxime</hi> in Law, that every land may be charged one wayes or another, and we are within this reaſon alſo, for if this eſtate be in the Plantiff, then this may be releaſed.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, the foundation of every act ought to be regarded, for <hi>Grants</hi> caſe there vouched deſtroyes the poſſibility with a fine by reaſon of the original act, the fourth reaſon there remembred is, becauſe that if the deviſee had been dead, his Executor ſhall have the intereſt, the ſame reaſon in our caſe, if the Plantiff had been dead before the remainder or the contingencie hap, yet his heir ſhall have that. See <hi>Shelleys caſe;</hi> the fifth reaſon is, the legacie was in preſent, though this was to take effect in <hi>futuro,</hi> and ſo in our caſe the Will is in preſent, though the ſtate is to take effect in <hi>futuro,</hi> and ſixthly, it ſhall be againſt reaſon to eſtabliſh ſuch a perpetuity of a Chattel, and ſo in our caſe it ſhall be againſt reaſon to eſtabliſh a perpetuity of a franktenement: and the releaſe is very well penued, for it is of all his title, right and claim to the reverſion, and remainder which the father de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed to the Plantiff, and ſo the releaſe is not general, but this is a particular, and ſpecial releaſe of that which was deviſed to him by his father, and <hi>Hoes caſe Coo.</hi> 5. is not like to our caſe, for firſt there the duty was altogether incertain, and ſecondly, the condition there did precede the duty: but in our caſe the condition is annexed to the eſtate, and ſo he concluded and prayed judgement in the caſe for the Defendant.</p>

Firſt is a ſufficient conſideration as of blood, or marriage, or other Collateral conſiderations, as if I covenant with you, that when you infeoffe me of certain land, I will ſtand ſeiſed to the uſe of you and your heirs, this is good, but if the conſideration be for money, then

this ought to be inrolled, or otherwiſe no uſe will ariſe, the ſecond point is, there ought to be a deed to teſtifie this agreement, for otherwiſe no uſe will ariſe, as was reſolved <hi>38.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Iuſtice Winch</hi> argued to the ſame purpoſe, and he ſaid the firſt part of the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant contains, that there ſhall be a marriage before ſuch a day if the parties ſhall agree, and the ſecond part is a covenant, that the feme ſhall have <hi>6. l. 13. s.</hi> for her joynture, and if this covenant executed an uſe of the land preſently, then this deſtroyes the joynture, which was not the intention of the parties. Thirdly, there is another covenant to convey Coppihold land, and if this covenant do raiſe an uſe, then it will follow that <hi>Iohn Buckley</hi> ſhall have the land, though the marriage do take effect, and beſides the covenant doth create an uſe preſently, or not at all, and then when this uſe is to be raiſed by this covenant which contains in that nothing but future and Executory matter, this will not create a preſent uſe: and he cited the books which were vouched at the barre, and by <hi>Hutton,</hi> and ſo he concluded, that this covenant will not raiſe an uſe preſently to <hi>Iohn Buckley,</hi> and that judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ought to be given for the Plantiff.</p>
                  <p>And at another day the caſe was argued by <hi>Hobert chief Iuſtice</hi> for the Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiff, and that no uſe will ariſe by this covenant, and he ſaid, if I will covenant to make aſſurance of my land to my ſon, or to a ſtranger, this covenant is meerly <hi>nugatorie,</hi> and will not raiſe an uſe, but on the contrary, if I will covenant to ſtand ſeiſed to the uſe of my ſon, though there is alſo a covenant to make further aſſurance, yet this will raiſe a preſent uſe, for the covenant is declaratory, and not obligatory, and ſo is <hi>Dyer 235.</hi> and there was no word to aſſure the land, or to ſtand ſeiſed to uſes, but only that the land ſhall come, remain, and be in tail, or in fee, and there was no word to aſſure the land: and this caſe is agreeable to the caſe of <hi>21. H. 7. 18.</hi> by <hi>Rede,</hi> that no uſe will ariſe; and the reaſon is plain, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the covenantor had election, in which manner he ſhall have that, whether by diſcent, or in any other manner, for if I covenant that my land ſhall deſcend to my ſon after my death, no uſe will ariſe by this covenant, and he put the caſe in <hi>Chudleys caſe,</hi> that if a man covenant that after his death his ſon ſhall have his

land in tall, it is ſaid that the ſon ſhall have an eſtate executed by the Statute of <hi>27. H. 8.</hi> and the covenantor ſhall have an eſtate for life, and ſo the law makes in that caſe fractions of eſtates, as the caſe of the <hi>Lord Seymor Dyer 96.</hi> ſeems to accord with this, and beſides thoſe two books he ſaid he could not finde any book which will warrant that, and for that reaſon he held thoſe two books to be no law, for if I Covenant, that my ſon ſhall have my land after my death, this will not raiſe an eſtate to me by implication for life, and an eſtate to my ſon, and ſo by ſuch means to change my eſtate in fee, for an eſtate for life without more words, for the word covenant in his proper and native ſignification is only obligatorie, and yet it had been alwayes conceived ſufficient to raiſe an uſe to him who is not par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie to that, as if I covenant with a ſtranger, that I will ſtand ſeiſed of my land to the uſe of my ſon, this will raiſe an uſe to my ſon, and yet neither my ſon, nor the covenantee may have an action of covenant, but an uſe will very well a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe to my ſon, as if a man bargain, and ſell his land in conſideration of <hi>100.</hi> l. paid by <hi>I. S.</hi> though in this caſe the conſideration ariſeth from a ſtronger; yet that will paſs the uſe to the bargainee: and in caſe of covenant, it is not this word covenant only which creats the uſe, but it is rather the agreement of the parties which is teſtified by the covenant, for if ſufficient agreement appears, there will not need this word covenant, as if I will agree and declare to ſtand ſeiſed to the uſe of my ſon, by which it appears that the word covenant is onely declarative of the intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the parties; and then in the principal caſe the covenant is, not that the ſon ſhall have the land, but that the land ſhall come, remain, and be to him: and thoſe words are incertain as <hi>21. H. 7.</hi> redert, come, or diſcent: and for that reaſon it is all one with the law of the ſame caſe, and then void to raiſe any uſe for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainly: and then when <hi>Andrew Buckley</hi> covenants, that his ſon ſhall have his lands and no words to inforce his intention: and for that reaſon the intention ſhall be lyable to an action of covenant, and not to change his eſtate which he had in fee, for an eſtate for life by this covenant, but if he had expreſly covenanted that in conſideration of marriage of his ſon, that he would hold his land for life, and after this ſhould be to his ſon, this will change the eſtate which was in fee, for an eſtate for life, but in our caſe the covenant being general and left to the indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent conſtruction of the law, the word covenant ſhall be taken in his proper and native ſignification, and this is obligatorie: and ſo he concluded, that this co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant being at the firſt to grant a rent, and was executory, and the laſt part of that is executory for aſſurance: and the limitation of the eſtate to the ſon being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangled between theſe two Covenants, this ſhall be of the ſame nature; and by conſequence the covenant is obligatorie only, and will raiſe no uſe to the ſon: and ſo he concluded, that judgement ſhall be given for the Plantiff, and it was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to be entered accordingly.</p>

                  <p>And after in <hi>Trinity term</hi> 21. <hi>Iac.</hi> the ſame caſe was argued again by <hi>Attoe</hi> for the Plantiff, and by <hi>Hitcham</hi> for the Defendant, and <hi>per totam Curiam</hi> at that time it was agreed cleerly, that this is a departure; but for the ſecond point, whether the pleading of the certificate were good or no, that was the doubt; and <hi>Iuſtice Hutton</hi> thought there ought to be a certificate precede the indenture, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe that ſhall be void; but <hi>Hobert,</hi> as to that would not give his opinion, but he ſeemed as <hi>Hutton,</hi> and <hi>Hobert chief Iuſtice</hi> took exception to the laying of the action, for he thought the Statute of the 5. <hi>of Eliz.</hi> ſhall not be intended ſo ſtrong againſt infants, as to make Collateral covenants to be good: but <hi>Attoe</hi> moved that this covenant is incident to the retainer to ſerve truly and faithfully, and yet if it were a Collateral covenant, yet he had loſt the advantage of that by his pleading, as in debt upon an obligation againſt an infant, if he plead <hi>non eſt factum,</hi> he ſhall not have advantage of his Infancy, to which <hi>Hobert</hi> alſo agreed; but he ſaid, this is not like to our caſe, for here it appears by the Count of the Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiff, that the Infant was but of the age of 15. years at the time of the retainer, of which the Court ought to take notice: and here the Infant was not bound by this Covenant at the Common Law, and no Collateral covenant ſhall be main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainable upon the Statute, for this being againſt an Infant, it ſhall be taken ſtrictly, as a cuſtome that one ſhall infeoffe, yet that cuſtome will not warrant him to leaſe and releaſe: and as to that which had been ſaid, that it is incident to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry retainer to ſerve truly and faithfully, that is very true, and an action upon the caſe lies upon a covenant in law, but not upon the covenant in fact, he ought to have Collateral ſecuritie, which was alſo confeſſed by <hi>Hutton,</hi> and he ſaid more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, that the retainer is for the benefit of the Infant, that he learn his Trade, but the covenant here is for his diſadvantage, and for the advantage of his Mr. and for that reaſon it is void, as if an Infant had covenanted to pay 10. l. for the learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his Trade when his time was up. <hi>Winch Iuſtice</hi> contrary to that laſt point, for he thought the covenant to be incident to the retainer, and good though he is an Infant, as an Infant who levyes a fine, is alſo inabled to make an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denture to lead the uſes; and note that <hi>Hutton,</hi> and <hi>Hobert</hi> ſaid alſo, that the barre of the Defendant is good, <hi>viz.</hi> the pleading of the want of the certificate, and for that reaſon the replication of the Plantiff, that he had 40. s. <hi>per annum</hi> is evil, and though the rejoynder of the Defendant is evil, and a departure; yet it appears that the Plantiff had not any cauſe of action: and for the covenant they ſaid, that they two are ſtrong in their opinions; and upon that <hi>Winch</hi> agreed alſo, that judgement ſhall be given againſt the Plantiff: and <hi>Attoe</hi> moved the Court, what remedy the Plantiff may have, for the loſs is 500. l. and <hi>per totam <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

years of the King of a Mannor, and <hi>I.

<pb n="68" facs="tcp:95435:40"/>
in law; and judgement was given for him, for <hi>Cook</hi> who was then <hi>chief Iuſtice</hi> ſaid, that a horſe may be of 40. <hi>or</hi> 100. l. price, and it ſhall be intollerable to allow ſuch Nuſance; and ſecondly, he had not made proclamation, and ſo treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs lies againſt, and ſo in our caſe. <hi>Harris Serjeant</hi> to the contrary; for when the Lord of a Mannor takes an eſtate, he had ſome kinde of property before the year is expired: and for that reaſon he may detain the eſtray againſt the owner, till amends is made to him 44. <hi>E.</hi> 3. 14. 29. <hi>E.</hi> 3. 6. by <hi>Knevet</hi> 20. <hi>H.</hi> 7. by <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſor, and Frewick:</hi> and if he had property againſt the owner himſelf, he may uſe that with moderation to make ſome benefit of that; eſpecially in caſe of neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, as 22. Aſſiſe 5. 6. a man may juſtifie the beating another if he be in a rage, and 6. <hi>E.</hi> 4. 8. one may juſtifie the felling of a tree in the ground of another in caſe of neceſſity; and here is no other way to reſtrain this Savage Colt, and ſo the juſtification is good, but in this caſe it was reſolved by <hi>Hobert, Winch and Hut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, Iones</hi> being in the Chancery. Firſt, when a beaſt comes within the Mannor of another Lord, this is a treſpas, but after the ſeiſure for an eſtray, it is a poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the eſtray in the Lord, and the beginning of property; as <hi>Hutton</hi> uſed the term, ſo that he may have an action of treſpaſs againſt any ſtranger, which takes that out of his poſſeſſion: and if he eſtray into the land of another, he may him re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, it was reſolved, that if the Lord make not proclamation in conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient time, that this poſſeſſion became tortious, for the law neceſſarily impoſeth it, upon the Lord of the Mannor, that he make Proclamation, becauſe that other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the owner may not come to the knowledge of him. Thirdly, that the eſtray within the year is, as a pledge in the Cuſtody of the law, till amends be made to the Lord: and for that reaſon the Lord may not work him no more, then he can work a diſtreſs. Fourthly, it was reſolved that if the eſtray goe into the Mannor of another Lord, and the laſt Lord claims that as an eſtray, the firſt Lord had loſt that, but not before claim. Fifthly, <hi>Hutton and Winch</hi> agree, that he might Fetter the Colt being ſo fierce, and wild, for he is anſwerable for the treſpas and wrong which he makes in the land of his neighbours; and alſo to the owner if he loſe him, and therefore it is unreaſonable, that he may not keep him ſafe for his indempnity: and that is not like to the caſe 27. Aſſiſe, which was urged of the other ſide, alſo they ſaid, fettering is the uſual way in the Country to reſtrain wild horſes: and therefore if it be in an ordinary manner, as he Fetters his own, there is not any remedy againſt the Defendant. <hi>Hobert chief Iuſtice,</hi> was againſt that laſt point, for the Lord may not hold him in <hi>arcta cuſtodia</hi> as a priſoner; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he had rather the keeping of an eſtray, the the property, and for that if the eſtray go into the land of another Lord, the firſt may not take him again, if the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther claims him as an eſtray, for the poſſeſſion was, rather in regard of his Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, then in regard of himſelf, and therefore he ſhall not anſwer for the wrong, which he doth in the lands of others, for the poſſeſſion is in regard of his Mannor: and his Fettering is an abuſe, and he may not neither uſe nor abuſe an eſtray, and he ſaid over, that the Defendant had not well pleaded for another reaſon, becauſe he had not ſhewed, that he proclaimed him in the next market Town within con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient time, which convenient time ought to be adjudged by the Court: and he ſaid, the Lord may not keep him elſe where within the year then within the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor: <hi>Winch Iuſtice</hi> ſaid, the Defendant ought to proclaim an eſtray, <hi>ut ſupra,</hi> if the year be paſt, for by that he gains an abſolute propertie; but here where no property is deveſted, he needs not to proclaim him within the year: and <hi>Hobert</hi> commanded this caſe to be moved again: ſee the laſt caſe but one in the book.</p>
                  <p>Ruled that after imparlance in debt upon an obligation, the Defendant ſhall be admitted to plead alwayes ready, though the 13. <hi>Eliz. in Dyer</hi> was urged to the contrary.</p>

                     <hi>TRehern</hi> brought an action of debt againſt <hi>Claybrook</hi> upon a leaſe for years, and upon <hi>nihil debet</hi> pleaded, and a ſpecial verdict, the caſe was to this effect; the Grandfather of the Plantiff was ſeiſed of lands in <hi>Southwark,</hi> and he made a leaſe for years of that to the Defendant at <hi>London</hi> rendring 45. l. rent, and after he deviſed the reverſion to the Plantiff in fee, and in his will he ſet forth that his intent was, that his Executors ſhall have the reverſion during the Term, upon condition that they enter into bond to pay 34. l. <hi>per annum</hi> at 4. uſual Feaſts during the Term; and he further deviſed, that this bond ſhall be made by the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe of his overſeers, and he limitted all this to be done within 6. moneths after his deceaſe, and if his Executors refuſe, his will was, that his overſeers ſhall take the profits upon the ſame condition; and appointed that both obligations be made to the Plantiff, and the deviſor died, and the Executors within 3. moneths ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the will to the overſeers, but no obligation was offered to be made within the 6. moneths, and the Plantiff required the Executors to enter into the obligation, and to pay the rent, which was not done, and he claimed the reverſion, and brought his action afterwards in <hi>London</hi> where the leaſe was made, and not in <hi>Southwark</hi> where the land did lie, and this caſe was twice argued by Councel at the barre; and now it was argued by the 3. Iuſtices. <hi>Hobert</hi> being abſent.</p>
                  <p>And <hi>Iones Iuſtice</hi> moved a point, which was not moved at the barre <hi>viz.</hi> that the Plantiff is deviſee of the reverſion, and ſo is privie in eſtate only, and for that reaſon the action ought to be brought in <hi>Southwark</hi> where the land lies: and not in London where the contract was made; but the leſſor himſelf had liberty to bring the action where he pleaſed, in regard of the privitie of eſtate and contract: and ſo was it adjudged in the Kings Bench, between <hi>Glover</hi> and <hi>Humble:</hi> and here though this be after verdict, and no exception taken by the Defendant; yet we as Iudges of the caſe may take notice of that <hi>ex officio,</hi> and give judgement a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Plantiff: and the 3. Iuſtices agreed, that here is a condition, by which the reverſion is veſted in them, but it is in the Plantiff till performance of that, which not being performed by them within the time limitted, the Plantiff ought to have the rent: and though the Will is, that it ſhall be with the adviſe of the overſeers, and no adviſe is found; yet that is at the peril of the Executors, who ought to give notice of that to the overſeers, being to their advantage: and for that ſee 21. <hi>H.</hi> 6. 67. 46. <hi>E.</hi> 3. 5. 18. <hi>E.</hi> 3. 27. 11. <hi>H.</hi> 4. 13. which caſes were cited by <hi>Serjeant Harris</hi> at the barre; and they agreed, that the overſeers ſhall not have the reverſion, for though it was deviſed to them; yet that was upon the refuſal of the Executors, and no refuſal is found, but only a non performance of the condition: and alſo the deviſe is tied to them upon condition, to do that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in 6. moneths, which ought to be performed in convenient time at the leaſt, though it be in caſe of a Will: and ſo they concluded, that the Plantiff had right as to the matter in Law; but that judgement ſhall be given againſt him upon the matter <hi>ſupra;</hi> and it was reſolved, that this was not aided by any Statute of Ieofailes, for this is a miſtrial: but another point was moved, whether the Plantiff ſhall pay coſts, within the Statute of the 23. <hi>H.</hi> 8 or 4. <hi>Iac.</hi> the words of the Statute are, if the Plantiff be nonſuite, or verdict given againſt him upon a lawful trial; but here it was reſolved, that he ſhould not pay coſts, for no verdict is found a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Plantiff; but rather for him: and judgement is given againſt him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he miſtook his action, and in <hi>Biſhops caſe Coo.</hi> 5. judgement was given againſt the Plantiff, upon a material variance in the verdict, and no coſts was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven: and it is not only out of the letter of the Statute, but alſo out of the intent, for it may not be imagined, that the Plantiff had ſtirrd an unlawful ſuite, when the
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:95435:41" rendition="simple:additions"/>
matter which he declares is found for him: and that Statute is not taken by equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, as <hi>Hutton</hi> ſaid, for it hath been agreed here, that if Executors are nonſuite, or judgement given againſt them upon a verdict, they ſhall not pay coſts, within the Statute of the 23. <hi>H.</hi> 8. or 4. <hi>Iac.</hi> and ſo is the conſtant practiſe, for the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute ſpeaks of any contract or ſpecialty made with the Plantiff, or between the Plantiff and Defendant: and the Executor brings an action upon the contract of another: and in the principal caſe, judgement was entered, that the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant ſhould go without day: and that he ſhall not have coſts againſt the Plantiff.</p>

                     <hi>A</hi> Rent was granted to <hi>Sir Robert Napper,</hi> and if it happen that this annual rent to be behinde, that then the land ſhall at all times be open, and ſubject to diſtreſs of the Grantee, according to the true form and effect of the ſaid inden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; and upon all the pleading a demurrer was joyned, and the ſole doubt was, whether the laſt words were a diſtinct covenant by themſelves, for if they are, then the obligation is forfeit, for the lands are not open to diſtreſs, becauſe that the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of <hi>Sir Robert</hi> held that till the age of 24. years, or whether they are part of the former covenant, and then the former worde will qualifie that, becauſe there was not any act made by him to the contrary, and it was argued by <hi>Bawtrie,</hi> that they are all one covenant, for they charge the land with the Annuitie, and he covenants that this ſhall be open to diſtreſs, and it is all one matter and thing, and is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a covenant; and where one covenant doth depend upon another, there one expounds the other, ſo <hi>Dyer</hi> in <hi>Throgmortons</hi> caſe 151. and he urged many caſes which are cited there, and he cited the <hi>Lord Cromwels caſe,</hi> where words of proviſo are placed between words of covenants, yet they will work accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the intent of the perſons, and there it is ſaid, that <hi>ex antecedentibus et con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequentibus fiat relatio:</hi> and ſo it appears to him, that this referred to the eſtate which <hi>Sir Thomas</hi> had from his father, and that he made nothing to impeach or to alter that and he cited the caſe of <hi>Sir Moile Finch,</hi> though by the fine the Mannor of <hi>Beamſtone</hi> was deſtroyed; yet in the ſaid indenture, free egreſs and regreſs was reſerved to the Courts for the <hi>Lady Finch:</hi> &amp; afterwards an other fine was levi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of all the lands and Tenements, except the Mannor of <hi>Beamſtone,</hi> where in verity that was deſtroyed before, and yet the judges did conſtrue this to be a good exception, becauſe this was in verity the intent of the parties, and there they made a conſtruction upon the covenants, which did lead the fine, and upon the latter indenture which did direct the others, and ſo the principal caſe, in <hi>Althams caſe</hi> the judges did not only adjudge upon the firſt words of the leaſe, but upon altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and he cited the caſe of <hi>Hickmote</hi> where the exception extends to all the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the precedent deed: and <hi>Hendon</hi> argued to the contrary, that they were ſeveral covenants, and yet he granted, all the caſes cited by <hi>Bawtrie,</hi> but ſaid, they all ſtood upon this difference, where it is a joynt thing, and where it is a ſeveral thing as here, and for that reaſon, that ought not to be applies to that, for they are diſtinct ſentences, and not joynt, as is expreſſed in <hi>Sir Henry Finches caſe, Coo.</hi> 6. and they ought to be conſtrued as diſtinct covenants, for otherwiſe they ſhall not take effect at all, for then he had not any remedy, for the rent which is expreſly againſt the intentions of the parties, and <hi>Crawley Serjeant</hi> ſaid, that if the two firſt covenants were according to the title, and the laſt was only conditional, if the rent was behinde, that then it ſhould be open to diſtreſs, and the Court ſeemed that they were ſeveral covenants, but judgement was reſpited for that time; and the ſame Term, the caſe was moved again by <hi>Hendon,</hi> that they were diſtinct covenants, and that this was the ſcope of the indenture, and the intention of the parties, that this ſhould begin preſently, and ſecondly, the two covenants are of ſeveral natures, and if the third covenant be not ſeveral, then it is idle, for all is implied in the firſt, and day was further given to adviſe of that, but the opinion of the Court ſeemed to be for the Plantiff.

<pb n="83" facs="tcp:95435:48" rendition="simple:additions"/>
no <hi>audita querela</hi> will lie, and he ſaid here had been 3. objections made againſt this Statute; firſt, that every Act of Parliament which gives directions for the doing of a thing, ought to be preciſely purſued, and ſhall not have an expla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation upon an explanation, and he ſaid, that notwithſtanding this objection, he thought the Statute to be good, for in every Act of Parliament there is ſubſtance, and there is form, and if the ſubſtance be obſerved, though not every circumſtance, yet that is very good, and ſo is the caſe concerning conditions, which are as ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be obſerved as any thing, yet if the ſubſtance be obſerved, though not the very letter, yet this is very good; as the caſe of <hi>Scroop,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Cook. 10.</note> one Covenanted to ſtand ſeiſed, to deviſe uſes with a proviſee, that if he ſhall be diſpoſed to alter, diſanul, or change the uſes &amp;c. that then it ſhall be lawful, at all times at his pleaſure to do this by his writtag indented, under his hand ſubſcribed in the preſence of 3. wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes to diſanul them, and alſo by the ſame writing to determine and ſet down other uſes; now if by indenture in the preſence of three witneſſes, he do covenant with another to ſtand ſeiſed to other uſes &amp;c. here though there is no expreſs deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of the former uſes according to the words; yet the limitation of the new uſes do implie a determination of the former uſes, and ſo the ſubſtance of the words obſerved, though not the very litteral expreſſion: and ſo was it lately reſolved in this Court between <hi>Kenet</hi> and <hi>Lee,</hi> that where ſuch covenants were with power of revocation in his life time ſealed and delivered, now if in this caſe this be done by Will ſealed, this is a ſufficient revocation, for the intent was ſatisfied, and if in this caſe, then by the ſame reaſon in our caſe; but now let us come to this Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute, and in this Statute there are matters of ſubſtance, and matters of circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance; and the Statute of <hi>Acton Burnel</hi> ſaith, that the debtor ſhall come be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Maior to acknowledge that, now this is but a circumſtance of the Statute, for if the Maior come before him, this is very good, for the ſubſtance is, that the Statute muſt be acknowledged before the Maior in proper perſon, and not by Attorney, and alſo the Statute ſaith, that the recognizance be entred into the Roll with the hand of the Clark, here the inrolment is the ſubſtance, and not the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, and ſo the Statute <hi>de mercatoribus</hi> is, that he ought to come before the chief Officer of the Citie &amp;c. and yet it hath been ruled here, that if the Citie be governed by 2. chief officers, he ought to come before them both, for to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe they are but one: nay, the Statute is, that he ſhall be a Merchant who ſhall acknowledge that, and yet if he be not a Merchant, he is within the compaſs of the Statute to be a Conuſor; but now to the point, whether this is ſubſtance or circumſtance, and I am of opinion, that though the day of payment is not expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, yet it is very well, for a day may be in that, and yet not be good, as if it be at <hi>Michaelmas</hi> after <hi>I. S.</hi> ſhall come to <hi>Pauls,</hi> now in this caſe, becauſe it may not appear to the Maior Iudicially when to award execution, therefore it is not good; but if this be to pay the firſt return of <hi>Michaelmas Term,</hi> this is very good, for there he may know immediately when to award execution, and the ſame law if it be to pay before <hi>Michaelmas</hi> next, or to pay preſently, as an obligation, and ſo the Maior is bound to take notice, that this is to be paid preſently.</p>
                  <p>Another objection that it ſhall be frivolous, that his bodie ſhall be taken ſo ſoon as it is acknowledged, but I anſwer, that this may be very well, for this is for the ſecuritie of the Merchant who is the Conuſee, and Merchants ſhall not be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to know when tendring may be, in regard, that they are ſuppoſed to be men of forreigne imploment, and ſo upon the Statute of Bankrupts, for the words of the Statute are, to every creditor a portion is allotted to him; by your conſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the ſale ſhall be void, becauſe it is not according to the words of the Statute, but you ſee that this is ruled to be againſt you.</p>
                  <p>The third objection is explanatorie to the Statute of <hi>Acton Burnel;</hi> and for that it ought to be preciſely peruſed and not to varie from that, but I anſwer to that, that the Statute <hi>de mercatoribus</hi> it ſelf had not been obſerved in every point and circumſtance, for the words of the Statute are, that if the debtor do not pay
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:95435:49"/>
at the day, that then the debtee may come before the Maior and ſue executtor, and yet it was reſolved <hi>Coo.</hi> 2. 48. that the executors of the Merchant may come; and beſides the words of the Statute are, that the extent ſhall be of all his lands, which were in the hands of the debtor at the time of the Statute acknowledged, and yet if he who is the Conuſor purchaſe lands afterwards; yet they ſhall be liable to be extended by force of the ſame Statute, though not made mention of, and ſo it is out of the words of the ſame Statute; and ſo I am of opinion, that the Statute is good, and that in this caſe no <hi>audita querela</hi> lies.</p>

Fourthly, the ſeal of the King ought to be to that: and fifthly, this ought to be inrolled: and it hath been alſo agreed to my hand, that a conjectural day of pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is not good, as at <hi>Mich.</hi> after the return of ſuch a one from Rome, or after the accompliſhment of the age of 27. years, for thoſe ſhall never be dayes to give ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction, though they are good by way of contract: and ſuch a recognizance is good, for any thing for which an action of debt will lie, but if no action of debt will lie in this caſe, then it is not good; and ſo is alſo the Statute of 23. <hi>H.</hi> 8. <hi>cap.</hi> 6. for it doth not extend to ſuch things; but where an action of debt lies.</p>
                  <p>And the firſt part of the Statute is, that the debt and the day of payment be entred in the roll, that ſo it may appear whether the day be paſt nor no, and that may not appear by the judgement of the law, but upon the face of the Statute, and there is alſo one clauſe in the Statute, that if the debtor will ſay, that his goods were delivered, or ſold for leſs then they were worth the partie had no remedy, for when the Sheriff had ſold them, the debtor may accompt it his follie, that he ſold them not before the day of the ſuit; but if in our caſe, the money is payable pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently, he had then no time to ſell them, for certainly the meaning of the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute was, in this to give time to the Conuſor to allien, and to ſell his goods; and ſo of a recogniſance taken before the chief Iuſtice, upon the Statute of the 23. <hi>H.</hi> 8. without queſtion a day ought to be limitted when that ſhall be paid, and there ought to be the ſeal of the partie, and the ſeal of the King, and the day of the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſpecified, and my firſt reaſon wherefore this Statute is void, is becauſe when an act of Parliament limits juriſdiction or power to any inferiour man, he ought to puſue his limitted juriſdiction preciſely in all the ſubſtantial points: as the Statute of <hi>Magna Charta</hi> limits, that he ſhall hold his turn <hi>viz.</hi> the Sheriff with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in one moneth after <hi>Michaelmas</hi> or <hi>Eaſter,</hi> now if he hold that but 2. dayes after it is void.</p>
                  <p>And the reaſon is, he ought to puſue this limitted juriſdiction, and then what difference is between thoſe ſeveral juriſdictions, and I cannot compare that to a better caſe,<note place="margin">Cook 10.</note> then to <hi>Neufages caſe</hi> upon the Statute of the 23. <hi>H.</hi> 6. if the Sheriff
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:95435:49"/>
do take an obligation for an appearance, if it do not appear in the condition, when the day of appearance is, then this obligation is void, for the day of appearance ought to appear expreſly; and not to leave this to the conſtruction of the law, and then what difference is there between our caſe: indeed contracts may be many times made good by reference, but ſo may not a Recognizance; and yet 17. <hi>Edw.</hi> 4. a man made a contract to give ſo much for Corn when he ſaw that, and the contract by the Iuſtices was awarded void, becauſe that no day was ſet when that ſhould be paid, and ſee the book which is, I conceive that if the contract had been to pay, when he took the Corn it had been good, and ſo here if a man had ſuch a juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, he ought to purſue that preciſely; and for that the day in all thoſe caſes ought to be obſerved, and a <hi>fortiori</hi> in our caſe: and an other reaſon is out of the preſidents in all times, and though there may be ſome few which doth paſs, <hi>ſub ſilentio</hi> yet I do not value them according to <hi>Slades caſe:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Cook 4.</note> and 5. <hi>Edw.</hi> 4. and all the ſubſequent Statutes ſince the Statute of <hi>Acton Burnel,</hi> are but declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and additions to this Statute, and as <hi>Grants caſe</hi> upon the Statute of 32. <hi>H.</hi> 8. nay that is not only a Statute of explanation, but is alſo an original Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute, but the Statute of 34. <hi>H.</hi> 8. of Wills is meerly a Statute of explanation, and for that reaſon in <hi>Buckler</hi> and <hi>Bakers caſe</hi> is,<note place="margin">Cook 3.</note> that Act to be conſtrued preciſely according to the word, and no new interpretation may be made of that; and for an anſwer to that which my brother <hi>Iones</hi> ſaid, that here is a day equevolent to an expreſs day, for it is implied in law to be paid preſently, according to the caſe of an obligation; but I ſay, that in this caſe there is a diverſitie in our books, in the caſe of an obligation, 14. <hi>Edw.</hi> 4. 14. <hi>H.</hi> 8. 29. and other books, whether this is payable preſently or upon requeſt, and therefore in a caſe ſo <hi>dubious</hi> it is not fit to make an ignorant Maior to judge another caſe, by the rule of this caſe being ſo <hi>dubious,</hi> and ſo doubtful, for if in this caſe it be not payable without a requeſt, then this is matter of fact, and not triable before him, nay the Statute of <hi>merca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toribus</hi> it ſelf appoints that the day be mentioned, and ſo both the Statutes do mention, that there ought to be a day of payment appointed and fixed in the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute, and then wherefore ſhall we make conſtruction, that an implyed day will ſo ſerve the turn; and in the Statute <hi>de mercatoribus</hi> the form of the writ is ſet down, which doth expreſly mention a day, and ſo I think there is not any doubt, but that if it were a Recogniſance upon the Statute of of 23. <hi>H.</hi> 8. for default of day it ſhall be void: and ſo in our caſe, and ſo he ſaid the <hi>audita querela</hi> lies well.</p>

<pb n="86" facs="tcp:95435:50" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to be proved after by averment; and here when no time is fixed, this is payable pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently; but there ſhall need to be a requeſt, then I hold it is out of the Statute, and when Satutes are obſcure, they ought to be interpreted according to the rules of the common Law, and as to the caſe of an obligation, it is payable preſently, and we ought to intend that the Maior takes notice, that this ought to be paid pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently, for ignorance of the law is not ſuppoſed of any; beſides, if this Statute be abſolutely void, then the partie is without remedy, and in ſuch a caſe we ought to b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>HObert chief Iuſtice</hi> to the ſame intent: I hold that the Statute is good, and we ought to beware how we deſtroy aſſurances, except it be upon good and ſure grounds: and it is a perilous caſe, to make an ignorant man to loſe his right by a ſlip, and we ought to be the more warie, becauſe this is for Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants, and the Statute was made for their ſecuritie, and by intendment they are men of forraign imployment, and ſo have the leſs occaſion to know the Law, and theſe Statutes of traffick are to be cheriſhed and not be pared to the verie quick, and we all agree that every ſubſtantial matter ought to be purſued, but not circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and then the queſtion is, whether this be ſubſtance or circumſtance, and we alſo agreed that there ought to be a time certain when the money ſhall be paid, and that is either an actual time or a legal time, and for the material points, that ought to be acknowledged before an officer, and in the Statute of <hi>Acton Burnel</hi> this word Maior is in that, and no other principal officer, and yet there is no doubt but that this may be taken before another, who is a principal officer of a corpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, though he be not a Maior. Secondly, this ought to be alſo before the Clark. Thirdly, it ought to contain words obligatorie. Fourthly, there ought to be a perſon bound. Fifthly, this ought to contain a ſumme, but it may be a doubt if an action of debt will lie for that. Sixthly, it ought to be under the ſeal of the partie. Seventhly, it ought to be under the ſeal of the King. Eightly, the inrolments is alſo neceſſarie, and this Statute is ſuch a remedy as the Common Law never gave to the King himſelf, ſo all aſſurances in this kind are to be made to the Merchants, and certainly in our caſe the day is not ſo material; but the time which the law will take notice of, for the ignorance of the Maior muſt not make any Statute void, and I do not grant the caſe, that if this was to pay 10. l. after the death of <hi>S. P.</hi> this will not make that void, but if the Statute be to pay at ſeveral dayes, then then it is a quere in law, whether it be payable till all the dayes of payment be paſt as of a bond; and for the writ, it is but to proportion our actions according, and to do after this way, or manner; and ſo upon the whole matter I conclude that the Statute is good, and that the <hi>audita querela</hi> doth not lie; and judgement <hi>per Curiam</hi> was commanded to be entered againſt the Plantiff.</p>
                  <p>The caſe of <hi>Giles Bray</hi> was moved again in arreſt of judgement, and <hi>Hendon</hi> ſaid, that the Plantiff had declared of a waſte made after the death of the ſaid <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mund Bray</hi> the Grandfather, which was to his diſinheritance &amp;c. and the Iury did finde the original leaſe and aſſignment, and they found that the waſte was made before ſuch a day, which was before the death of the Grandfather, and now he ſaid, that becauſe it is found generally, that before the death of the Grandfather the waſte was made, and this was found preciſely, and it is not found preciſely, that at the time of the waſte made he was termor in poſſeſſion, and that is not good, for it may be that he made that before the aſſignment, and then it is not puniſhable of waſte, and if the waſte was made in the life of the Grandfather, he ought ſo to
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:95435:50" rendition="simple:additions"/>
have declared, for otherwiſe it was not immediately to his diſinheritance; nay, the Grandfather might have during his life releaſed or confirmed to the Tenant, and ſo have determined the waſte, and then he in reverſion ſhall not recover: like to the caſe where an Abbot declares of the waſte againſt the leſſee of his predeceſſor, and declares of waſte generally, this is not good, for if this was made in the time of his predeceſſor, then he may not puniſh that, and ſo in our caſe, perchance the Grandfather had releaſed, and then he in reverſion may not recover, but as to the firſt exception the Court ſeemed, that becauſe the Plantiff ſhewed expreſly that he was poſſeſſed by vertue of the leaſe, and he being ſo poſſeſſed made waſte, the finding of the jury ſhall be agreeable to that: and ſo this exception was over ruled, and for the other, the rule of the Court was, that whether this waſte was commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the time of the Grandfather, or after his death, this waſte was to his diſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance, and the Grandfather by his releaſe might not by any means diſcharge that waſte, for he may not transfer that priviledge, and ſo the judgement was given for the Plantiff.</p>

                     <hi>HUtton</hi> to the contrary, I hold that they are 3. ſeveral Covenants; and yet I agree the caſes afore cited, and the reaſon is, they are all included in one ſentence, for it is the care of the Purchaſor, that he had an owner of the land be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he purchaſe, for that which is the ground of aſſurances, that he is ſeiſed in fee, and hereafter that the Covents that this is free from incumberances made by him, and that he had good title to alien which ſtrikes at the very root of aſſurances, and my firſt reaſon is, becauſe here are ſeveral parties, and they covenant that one of them is ſeiſed of a good eſtate, and that they or one of them had power to alien that, for it may not ſtand with the intents of the indentures, to buy of him who had no title, and might not ſell, and alſo the laſt Covenant is meerly in the negative, that they have made no Act or Acts by which the reverſion ſhall be in the King; and that is all one, as if the word Covenant had been added in every clauſe of the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, and Covenants in law may be qualified by expreſs Covenants, but if a man made a leaſe for years upon condition to pay 20. l. in this caſe an entrie by the law is implyed for default of payment; but yet if it added that, if it be behinde he may enter and retain till he is ſatisfied of the 20. l. now in this caſe this had taken away the implyed Covenant and condition, but every expreſs Covenant muſt be taken moſt beneficially for the Covenantee, and in <hi>Nokes caſe</hi> it is ſaid, that an expreſs Covenant controuls an implied one, but he may uſe either of them at his pleaſure and election: and I grant <hi>Henry Finches</hi> caſe to be good law, for there is not any clauſe or ſentence till after the <hi>Alibie;</hi> but yet in <hi>Dyer</hi> 207. they are diſtinct ſentences, and ſhall receive ſeveral conſtructions, and ſo here the matter being ſeveral they ſhall receive divers conſtructions, and he Covenanted that he was ſeiſed in fee, and that he had power to alien that, and this was to encourage the Purchaſers: and for the form he needs not aver, that this was in the hands of <hi>Anne Parker,</hi> for he had confeſſed that in the bar, that he came lawfully to that, and beſides the Covenant is broken, though he never was ſeiſed, and ſo I conceive that the Plantiff ſhall have judgement.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Winch</hi> to the ſame intent, it is true if it had been all but one Covenant, then
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:95435:53" rendition="simple:additions"/>
if it had been no queſtion this had not been broken; but I think they are ſeveral Covenants, like to the caſe of <hi>Sir Robert Napper</hi> lately adjudged; alſo the firſt two Covenants are in the affirmative, and the other in the Negative, and for that they ought to be anſwered with ſeveral pleas, and theſe kinde of aſſurances are the Common aſſurances, and therefore they ought to be interpreted favourably for the Purchaſers, and <hi>Iohn</hi> was not deceived in theſe Covenants, for they brought down upon the deed an eſtate in fee, and it is alſo agreed if the word Covenant and grant had been divers times added to the ſeveral clauſes, then they had been ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Covenants, and now it is all one word, and made thoſe to be ſeveral Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants; and words of relation never will controul that which is certainly put down before; and ſo he concluded in this caſe the Plantiff ſhall have judgement to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Hobert chief Iuſtice</hi> to the contrary, every deed ought to be conſtrued according to the intention of the parties, and the intents ought to be adjudged of the ſeveral parts of the deed, as a general iſſue out of the evidence, and intent ought to be picked out of every part, and not out of one Word only: and here <hi>Peter</hi> joyned with his father to ſtrengthen the aſſurance, and <hi>Iohn</hi> had not only his own eſtate, but the eſtate of <hi>Proud;</hi> and it is plain he never meant to intangle himſelf with other Conveyances, then thoſe which he and <hi>Proud</hi> had made, and I hold this to be no independent Covenant, and it is all bound with one clauſe <hi>(S.)</hi> for any Act or Acts made by them &amp;c. and it is confeſſed if theſe words had been placed in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front, that then they ſhould relate to all, and it is as clear as if they were: and the firſt reſon is, that the intent appears only to undertake for himſelf, becauſe he ſhould but have part of the land, and for that he was to warrant his evidence, and to that end he was to deliver to him his title at large in the ſaid indenture: and here he had made the Plantiff privie to every ſeveral conveyance of that to inform the Purchaſer of it: and will you alſo intangle him with a covenant, you might have taken notice of his title; and it appears to be the very intents of the parties, that you ſhould take notice of the title, and inform your ſelves concerning the ſame. Secondly, this is a ſentence which may be taken both wayes: and I ſay it is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed that if it had begun with theſe words notwithſtanding any Act or Acts &amp;c. that then it ſhall be all conſtrued by this, and I never ſaw any difference: I grant they are ſeveral Covenants in point of fact, but not in point of obligation, for there are not ſeveral words of binding; nay I ſay if he had releaſed this laſt he had releaſed all, but it hath been ſaid, that one is in the negative, and the other is in the affirmative: but I do not value that; and it hath been ſaid, that this is the Common aſſurance of the Realm, and if other conſtruction ſhall be made, then no man ſhall be ſure of his own, we had given him leave to ſay that no reverſion nor remainder is in the King by any Act by him made, and the King may not have any reverſion, and he ſeiſed in fee, alſo this clauſe ſtanding indifferent, whether this ſhall be referred to all or not, and then the queſtion is, how the Court will adjudge of that, for my part I take it that this may ſtand with the intent of all the parties of the deed; but take that as you take it, that this deſtroyes all, for if he is abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſeiſed in fee, what matter is where the reverſion is, and yet if the reverſion was in the Crown, and not by his Act you confeſs that may not charge him, which is expreſly againſt the firſt Covenant, if this be diſtinct by it ſelf, but take that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differently, and all the parties will ſtand together: <hi>Nappers caſe</hi> hath no affinity with this, for queſtionleſs there were ſeveral Covenants, for in that indenture it did not appear what eſtate <hi>Sir Thomas Eearſfield</hi> had, and for that reaſon nothing might be collected out of that, but he had a preſent eſtate; but in our caſe all is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the bodie of the indenture, and <hi>Nokes caſe</hi> is a ſtrong caſe, and ſtronger then the caſe at the bar is, for thereupon conſtruction of all the parties of the deeds, the ſpecial warrantie controuls the general warranty: and the reaſon is no man will take an expreſs ſpecial warranty when the intent is, that he ſhall have a general warranty: &amp; there was a caſe lately ajudged between the <hi>Earl</hi> of <hi>Clanrickard</hi>
                     <pb n="94" facs="tcp:95435:54" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and his wife againſt the Counteſs of <hi>Leiceſter,</hi> where the Lady pleaded that ſhe was Tenant in Dower, where in veritie ſhe had the reveſion in fee expectant upon a Term for life, and they conveyed all the eſtate the Lady had in Dower; and then they covenanted, that they would convey all their eſtate to the Lord of <hi>Leiceſter</hi> and his heirs, during the life of his wife, and then Covenanted that they would convey all their eſtate to the <hi>Earl of Leiceſter</hi> and his heirs for ever in the aforeſaid land: and it was reſolved, that though ſuch Covenant will raiſe an uſe to the partie who ought to have that, and ſo the reverſion will paſs if there had been no more words: now it was but during the life of the Lady for that third part, for the Covenant was but to ſtrengthen an eſtate, and not to convey it, and ſo he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded that the Plantiff ſhould be hard, and after it was ſaid by the Court, that this caſe was not of weight to be brought into the Exchequer Chamber, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Court adviſed that the parties would agree; quere, for the reſidue in the Exchequer Chamber concerning that.</p>

made a confirmation of a leaſe for part of the time which was made by the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and agreed that this ſhall ſtretch to the whole time, and no better caſe may be put then the caſe of <hi>Packhurſt,</hi> in <hi>Dyer</hi> 22. 8. where <hi>Packhurſt</hi> was incumbent of the Church of <hi>Cleave</hi> and was made Biſhop of <hi>Norwich,</hi> but before he was created Biſhop, he had a diſpenſation from the Arch-Biſhop to retain that in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendam for 3. years, notwithſtanding his advancement; and he reſigned during the 3. years and iſſue there taken upon the reſignation; and this caſe proves all the partes of our caſe, firſt that the King may diſpence, and that by his diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion he is compleat perſon to reſign: and if he do reſigne during the years, the King ſhall not have the prerogative to preſent again, for that was ſatisfied with the diſpenſation: and alſo when the King came to his prerogative by ſubjects means, he ought to take that as it falls, for otherwiſe he loſes that quite, <hi>vide Baſtervils caſe Coo.</hi> 7. and another reaſon is, if it be not ſatisfied, then the King ſhall have another which is miſchievous, and this being a new caſe ſuch preſident is not to have more favour then the neceſſitie of the Law will require: and ſo my opinion is, that it is all one as if it had for life: and there is a good caſe 9. <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. 20. where the King had 2. preſentments, <hi>vide</hi> the caſe; but it was upon another reaſon, but the caſe of 21. <hi>H.</hi> 7. 8. <hi>Frowike:</hi> where the grantee of the next a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voydance had judgement to recover, and the incumbent reſigned, ſo that it is the ſecond preſentment, yet the Plantiff ſhall have the effect of his judgement, and he had a writ to the Biſhop; quere the application, for I did not well heare that, but in our caſe, if the prerogative of the King was not ſatisfied; yet it ought to appear that when he preſented <hi>Gee.</hi> he had no title, but that was an uſurpation: and if the King was not ſatisfied, then the Plantiff ſhall not have judgement, for then <hi>Gee</hi> was an uſurper: and upon that declaration the Plantiff ſhall be barred; but now for the laſt point, admit that the King was ſatisfied of his prerogative by his preſentation of <hi>Gee,</hi> whether the Plantiff had loſt his courſe, &amp; I think he had, &amp; in the firſt place the words of the deviſe are the firſt, &amp; the next avoydance which ſhall hap after the death of <hi>Athur Baſſet,</hi> now it hath been objected, that the King had the firſt by his prerogative, and therefore he ſhall have the ſecond, &amp; I think in this caſe <hi>Brook</hi> preſentation 52. is a ſtrong caſe, where a preſentation was granted to one, and after to another, when the firſt is void, and ruled that the ſecond grantee ſhall not have the ſecond, and ſo <hi>Dyer</hi> 35. it ought to be taken according to the words, for otherwiſe he ſhall not have any, for <hi>modus et Conventio uniunt Legem,</hi> and the caſe of <hi>quare Impedit</hi> 152. proves ſomething to this purpoſe, for a man had 4. advowſons, and granted the next which ſhould hap of them to <hi>I. S.</hi> and he died, and the heir aſſigned the wife for her Dower one Mannor to which the advowſon was appendant, which firſt became void, and ruled that the Grantee ſhall not have that againſt the feme, and then it was moved by <hi>Thorpe,</hi> that he ſhall have the ſecond, but <hi>Shard</hi> ſaid certainly never, which proves that, if the turn of the Grantee was taken from him by the indowment of the feme he had loſt that for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver: the like caſe is the 15. <hi>H.</hi> 7. 7. 14. <hi>H.</hi> 7. 22. moved by <hi>Mordant,</hi> that the Grantee of the third ſhall have the fourth, when the wife is indowed of the third, which caſe is brought to prove a caſe, which without queſtion is not law, and that is that the King being Gardian of the Grantee of the next avoydance, and he grant that, in this caſe the heir ſhall have that at his full age, which without queſtion is now law, for by the ſame reaſon his courſe may be the 20. but there are two rules from this, which ſeem to croſs this opinion: one rule is that the words of the gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor ſhall be taken moſt ſtrong againſt himſelf, and the other that the Grantor ſhall not be received to avoid his own grant, as it is ſaid in <hi>Davenports caſe Coo.</hi> 8. but yet theſe rules are to be intended where the words are compleat, for as the caſe is the 13. <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. Grant 65. that where the husband and his wife are joynt Tenants for life, and he in reverſion grant the lands only which the husband held, in this caſe nothing paſſeth, for the reverſion was expectant upon a leaſe which the hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band and wife held: nay, I will cite one caſe, where a man by his own Act ſhall
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:95435:55"/>
avoid his own grant: in a <hi>quare Impedit Elmes</hi> againſt <hi>Taylor,</hi> where a man was ſeiſed of the Mannor, to which the advowſon was appendant, and he granted the third next avoydance, and after againſt his own grant he uſurped, and it was adjudged, that by this uſurpation he had gained the advowſon, to be appendant to his Mannor again, and that the Grantee had loſt his courſe, and ſo the caſe in <hi>Dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er</hi> 283. where the Church was void, and the patron granted the next avoidance <hi>tunc vacant.</hi> to another, and this <hi>pro hac unica vice tantum:</hi> and there reſolved, that the grant was not good, and that it ſhould not extend to another: and ſo in our caſe it ſhall not extend to a ſecond: another reaſon is, if the King had a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative he is bound, and every derivative eſtate under him, for he ſhall not be in better caſe, then the grantee, for he was bound by the law of the land: and for that it is equitie, and it is Iuſtice that the eſtate of the grantee ſhould be bound, and ſo in this caſe, like to the caſe in <hi>Plowden</hi> 207. and <hi>Dyer</hi> 231. where by Act of Parliament the poſſeſſions of an Abbot were bound, now if afterwards the Abbot made a leaſe for years, or granted the next avoydance, and then after they came to the King, he ſhall avoid the grant, for the intereſt of the Grantor was bound by Act of Parliament, and ſee the caſe of the univerſitie of <hi>Oxford Coo.</hi> 10. where a man before he was a recuſant convict, he granted the next avoydance, and after he became a recuſant convict, and then the Church became void, now the grantee ſhall not preſent, for his intereſt was bound by Act of Parliament, and ſo he muſt take it, and here it behoves him to take that, as it is bound with the prerogative of the King: and ſo upon all the matter he hath loſt his title, and he concluded that the Plantiff ſhall be barred.</p>

<pb n="99" facs="tcp:95435:56" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the Defendant had not denied it: but for the Commendam I do not make queſtion but the King may make one, and ſo may the Arch Biſhop, but the power of the Arch-Biſhop is <hi>poteſtas limitata,</hi> but the King had a double power, one by anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient title before any claim made by the Pope, and the other by the Statute; but now for the other point, I think it is a Commendam for years, and firſt I hold if the caſe had been that he ſhould hold that in Commendam with his Biſhoprick in <hi>priſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no Statu,</hi> that had taken away the power of the King to preſent afterwards, and the reaſon is plain, for the prerogative is to preſent to that which is void by the aſſumption of the Biſhoprick, which doth never hap, for by the Commendam he had that ſtill as before, but here the Commendam is for years, and if he do alſo reſign during the years, then this is void by reſignation, and ſo is the caſe of <hi>Pack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hurſt,</hi> that when he reſignes during the years of the Commendam, the Patron ſhall have that, and not the King: and ſo alſo my opinion is clear, that if he had died within the 6. years limitted by the Commendam, that the King ſhall not have that, for then it is void by death, and not by the aſſumption of the Biſhoprick, which book proves directly, that a Commendam may be aſwel for years, as for life; but yet I do not hold that upon thoſe temporary Commendams, if the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop continued Parſon during the years, and made no Act to impeach, that then is a void cauſe <hi>(S.)</hi> the aſſumption of the Biſhoprick, and then when that is deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined the ſupenſion is determined, and it is void by the original cauſe <hi>(S.)</hi> by the aſſumption of the Biſhoprick: and this Commendam doth not turn the ſecond or firſt Patron to any prejudice, for the incumbent is ſtill in by the preſentation of the Patron, and the determination of the Commendam is not any cauſe of the avoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of the benefice; but this is <hi>quaſi non cauſa,</hi> which is <hi>cauſa ſtolida,</hi> as the <hi>Logicians</hi> do term it: but in this caſe the aſſumption is the cauſe of the Ceſſion, and it is like to the caſe of 25. <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. 47. where the King brought a <hi>quare Impedit</hi> againſt the Arch-Biſhop of <hi>York</hi> for a Prebendary; <hi>vide</hi> the caſe: and ruled in that caſe, that the confirmation of the King had not taken away his title to preſent, and the reaſon was, becauſe the confirmation had not filled the Church, but continued that full which was full before, and here this temporarie Commendam may not reſtrain the King to preſent afterwards, for this is not a preſentation, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore may not take away the title of the King: and here the Plantiff hath not well ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed it, for he hath not ſhewed in this Court, that the preſentation of the King was lawful, neither that <hi>Chardon</hi> held that by vertue of the Commendam for all the 6. years, but only that the Church became void, by the Laws of <hi>England,</hi> and that is not ſufficient: and then if all before were for the Plantiff, yet the queſtion is, whether he hath loſt his turn: and I think that he hath, <hi>omnis argumentatio eſt à notoribus,</hi> and the firſt is better known, then the ſecond, and the ſecond may not be the firſt, and there when the deviſe gave him the firſt, it is idle to ſay, that he ſhall have the ſecond, for that departs from the meaning of the words, and in every grant the law implies <hi>quantum in ſe eſt,</hi> and no man may ſay, that the devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor did intend to warrant that from antient Titles; and ſo the <hi>Lord Hobert</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded his argument, and ſaid his opinion was, that the Plantiff ſhall be barred, and judgement was commanded to be entred accordingly.</p>

                  <p>And <hi>Crawley Serjeant</hi> argued for the Plantiff, and the ſubſtance of his argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was in this mannor, and firſt he ſaid, that he conceived the points to be upon the ſpecial verdict, either to concern the antient eſtate, or the new eſtate of the <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Ceſar,</hi> and here we are alſo to conſider, whether the uſes are well created and ſtand good, by the indenture, and by the fine without the help of the ſpecial verdict, and firſt I will not diſpute, when an Infant levies a fine, and dies before the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal of that, whether his heir may avoid that, and this is ruled in <hi>Cooks</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports 10. <hi>H.</hi> 7. 16. that this may not be, becauſe that this trial ought to be by inſpection, which now may not be, when he is deed, but that which I will inſiſt upon in the firſt place is this, when an infant made an indenture to declare the uſes of a ſubſeqent fine, and he doth after that at another time levie a fine generally with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out expreſſing of any uſe in the fine, whether he may any wiſe enter, and avoid the uſes of the ſame fine, or whether the law of neceſſity doth adjudge the fine to be to the ſame uſes, without the help of any Averment, and I hold that he may avoid thoſe uſes, which do ſtand upon this difference, that it is incongruous to reaſon, that if the law admits a man to be of abilitie to levie a fine, then at the ſame inſtant, or after he may declare the uſes, becauſe it it is intended, that he is of full age, and if this had been a fine with grant, and render in which there is alwayes an uſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, as 26. <hi>H.</hi> 8. 2, that the grant of an Infant is abſolutely void: but I do agree the caſe in <hi>Beckwiths caſe</hi> of a feme Covert.<note place="margin">Cook 2.</note> or of a man of nonſane me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, that their declaration of that ſubſequent uſe is good, becauſe that the fine which is levied by them, is a perpetual Bar and concluſion, and by ſuch means there diſpoſal doth conclude them for ever: but it is otherwiſe of an infant, for he may avoid the fine by error during the minoritie, and the opinion of the book of 46. <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. 34. is, that if an infant do alien a rent, he may bring a <hi>dum fuit infra aetatem,</hi> which ſeems to infer, that the grant of an infant is not abſoluely void; I anſwer that is but the admiſſion of the Court, and 15. 7. 4. if an infant made a deed, and at full age he inrolled that, this is a concluſion for him to denie that, for this inrolment is an affirmance of that, and the reaſon of that is, becauſe this is an affirmance of the ſame thing: but here the fine and the uſes are diſtinct, and for that they are voidable, and for the other point the derdict had found, that the fine was levied to the uſes aforeſaid, whether that had eſtabliſhed the uſes, and made them unavoidable ſo long as the fine is in force, and I hold that it had not, for it is no more then <hi>ad uſus ſupra dictos,</hi> and it had not bettered the uſes, for they had no reference to aide the uſes: like to the caſe of the Earl of <hi>Leiceſter</hi> in <hi>Plowdon,</hi> and the 5. <hi>Ed.</hi> 4. 41. and yet I grant that an Act of Parliament may make a thing void which was good, but ſo may not a fine, and ſo held the verdict had not aided that.</p>

                  <p>ANd now he argued to the third point, which is the great point, whether thoſe words if <hi>Robert</hi> do not pay, make a ſubſequent or a precedent condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and I hold that it is a precedent condition, and this interpretation ſtands beſt with the intentions of the parties, for before <hi>Ann</hi> had an eſtate for life, and <hi>Robert</hi> in fee, and if a preſent uſe will ariſe, then <hi>Ann</hi> ſhall have all preſently, and leave nothing to <hi>Robert,</hi> but if the uſes do forbear ſetling till the firſt of <hi>Septem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi> and ariſe according to payment, and all the doubt ſtands upon this word (if) which is ſome time taken as a limitation, as if a man gives land to another, and to the heirs of his body, and if he die without iſſue, then to another there (if) is a limitation, as it is in <hi>Beſtons caſe:</hi> but here this refers to a contingencie: and therefore it is a condition, and ſaving the opinion of <hi>Hide</hi> and of <hi>Mountague</hi> in <hi>Colthurſts caſe:</hi> I hold that (if) there was a condition, and regularly (if) is a note of a precedent condition: and I will firſt prove, that by Logick, for the word are an intire Hypothetical propoſition, <hi>(S.)</hi> the uſe ſhall be to <hi>An</hi> if &amp;c. and in this is a <hi>Hiſteron proteron invertio ordinis partium,</hi> that the conſequent ſhould be before the Antecedent: in this manner if <hi>Robert</hi> do not pay 10. l. to <hi>Anne</hi> the firſt of <hi>September,</hi> then it ſhall be to the uſe of <hi>Anne,</hi> and ſo <hi>quelibet pars in Loco proprio redigenda eſt,</hi> and then if it is ſo, it is no doubt but this is a precedent condition, and he cited <hi>Wheelers caſe</hi> 14. <hi>H.</hi> 8. a man granted his Term, if he could procure the good will of his Leſſor. and this was adjudged to be a precedent condition, and ſo is <hi>Bracton Lib.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 6. if the condition is in <hi>fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turis,</hi> then it is alwayes precedent as to do <hi>talem rem ſi dederis mihi</hi> 10. s. there it is ſaid, <hi>valet donatio ſed ſuſpenditur tanquam &amp;c.</hi> and if we obſerve quite thorough <hi>Wheelers caſe</hi> this is alwayes a note of a precedent condition, and yet I grant that in ſome caſe it may be a note of a ſubſequent condition, but that is <hi>quando impediatur &amp;c.</hi> as in the principal caſe in <hi>Colthirſt ſi vellet inhabitare</hi> there of neceſſitie this ought to be a ſubſequent condition.</p>
                  <p>Now the next point is, whether the condition is diſcharged by the the death of <hi>Robert</hi> before the firſt of <hi>September;</hi> and I hold that it is, for If diſtinguiſheth as if the word had been, that if <hi>Robert</hi> do not pay; yet if he die before the day, he is diſcharged of the payment, for there was not any default in him, for all Humane contracts muſt give way to this Statute of mortalitie, <hi>Statutum eſt omnibus mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri,</hi> and there was not any default in the heir of <hi>Robert,</hi> for he was not bound to pay, and therefore he needs not to do that being to his prejudice, but my chief rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is upon the general rule of all conveyances, for our law in its inſtitution was a Law of mercy, and will indeavour to iuſtifie Acts made in obedience to that, and to excuſe defaults of diſobedience: and this is the reaſon of <hi>Maſter Littletons caſe,</hi> if a feofment is made upon condition, that if the feoffor pay 10. l. ſuch a day &amp;c. now that being to reduce an eſtate is not taken litterally, but if the heir or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecutor pay that, this is ſufficient to reduce the eſtate, and ſo it may be paid at o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther places, and to other Parſons, and ſo if the condition is to be performed of the part of the feoffee, there his feoffee may pay that.</p>
                  <p>The next point is, whether any notice is requiſite, and he held that there ought to be notice, becauſe the heirs are ignorant of that; and in ſome caſe where a man is bound to take notice of that; yet by the Act of Law, that ſhall be diſcharg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as in <hi>Sir Andrew Corbets caſe:</hi> but now for that laſt point,<note place="margin">Cook 4.</note> whether the antient eſtate for life is gone, and it is clear, it was gone by the Common Law,

Firſt, whether by the indenture and fine, the <hi>Lady Ceſar</hi> had gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the inheritance. Secondly, if ſhe had not gained the inheritance, whether ſhe had kept her firſt eſtate, and for the firſt there are three pertinent points moved by my brother <hi>Crawley,</hi> to which I will add a fourth. Firſt, whether the words make a precedent or ſubſequent condition. Secondly, whether the death of <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert</hi> had diſcharged that, and that is become impoſſible. Thirdly, admit that this is become impoſſible, whether the uſe will ariſe to the <hi>Lady Ceſar,</hi> and I hold that it will ariſe to the <hi>Lady Ceſar.</hi> Fourthly, whether any notice is requiſite: and here firſt by the way, whether an infant may limit the uſes of a fine, I will not argue that, for ſo it is reſolved in <hi>Beckwiths caſe;</hi> and ſo is it cited in <hi>Mary Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingtons caſe</hi> to be adjudged, and there was one <hi>Lewes caſe</hi> 26. <hi>Eliz.</hi> before <hi>Wray</hi> and <hi>Anderſon,</hi> and the reaſon is apparant, that when the law had adjudged by inſpection, him to be at full age when he levies a fine, he ſhall never come after the fine is levied, and ſaid that he was within age at the time of the limitation of the uſes; nay, I will cite one caſe to ſhew how cautelous and warie the law is in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judging by inſpection: <hi>Poynts caſe,</hi> where an infant brought a writ of error to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe a fine, and day was given till <hi>Octabis Mich.</hi> to be adjudged by inſpection, and before the day the Term was adjourned till <hi>Menſe Michael.</hi> but between <hi>Octabis Mich.</hi> and <hi>Menſe Mich.</hi> he came of full age, and yet upon <hi>Octabis Mich.</hi> upon the Eſſoyne day <hi>Juſtice Crook</hi> took his inſpection <hi>de bene eſſe,</hi> and it was ruled, that now he may not avoid the fine, but he was forced to compound for the Land, and ſo the 6. <hi>Iac.</hi> was one <hi>Randals caſe,</hi> who reverſed a Statute by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of his minoritie by <hi>audita querela,</hi> and the laſt judgement, for ſome error in that was reverſed, and then he brought a new <hi>audita querela,</hi> when he was of full age, and he cited all the proceedings upon the firſt, and adjudged that the <hi>audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta querela</hi> doth lie, and ſo here, when the law inables him to levie a fine, the ſame inables him to declare the uſes; and now for the firſt point, whether this be a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent or a ſubſequent condition, for that is the fair <hi>Helena</hi> for which we fight, and yet I agree with my Brother <hi>Crawley,</hi> that in ſome Caſes there ſhall be a tranſpoſition of Terms, and the parts in the propoſition, in ſome caſes (if) is a note of a ſubſequent condition, and for this the judgement of the caſe in <hi>Colthirſts caſe,</hi> where a remainder was limited <hi>ſi ipſe inhabitare vellet,</hi> and to be a ſubſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent

condition: and ſo I will not denie, but that if a man make a feofment in fee, upon condition that if the feoffee pay 20. s. then he ſhall hold to him and his heirs, it is no queſtion but the fee ſimple paſſeth; and it is a ſubſequent condition to reduce that; but ſecondly, this doth better agree with the intents of the parties, and for the firſt, the fine is levied to the uſe of the Conuſee, and the Conuſee is now in by the Common Law; but defeaſable upon condition afterwards. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, the intents of the parties plainly do appear, that he ſhall have the land to the uſe of her and her heirs, if <hi>Robert</hi> do not pay 10. l. and if he doth, then to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther uſes, now if no former uſe had been expreſſed by which this will reſult, thoſe laſt words will, and I ſay no mean uſe will reſult; but it ſhall be to the uſe of the Conuſee, and thoſe words for ever, though they adde nothing to the eſtate of <hi>Anne,</hi> yet they ſerve to ſhew the intentions of the parties, that if he do not pay, then it ſhall be to the uſe of <hi>Anne</hi> and her heirs, and if he paid, then that ſhe ſhould have that for life; but it is abſolutely againſt the intents of the parties, that ſhe ſhall have neither, and for that of neceſſitie to ſupplie the intents of the parties, this ſhall be a ſubſequent condition; like to the caſe where a man levies a fine to the intent, that the Conuſee ſuffer a recovery againſt him, now of neceſſitie to have the intents of the parties fulfilled, the fine ſhall be to the uſe of the Conuſee for this time, though none is expreſſed, for otherwiſe it would reſult, and ſo in this caſe, that the intentions of the parties may be performed, this ſhall be a ſubſequent condition.</p>

                     <note place="margin">Cook 3.</note> the new Sheriff ought to take notice of the Execution upon the priſoners when he takes them, and ſo is the firſt of <hi>H.</hi> 7. 4. a man being bound to perform an arbitrement, he ought to take notice of that at his peril; but in our caſe here is a preſumption in law, that he had notice, for he had the land from his anceſtor, and in the ſame degree, and ſo the law doth intend, that he had notice of the conditions, and if he had not, it is the default of his Anceſtor, that he had not left his deeds with him. Secondly, the heir is privie to the condition, this doth deſcend to him, and therefore he ought to take notice of that: and put the caſe, that an Action of debt is brought againſt the heir, upon the obligation of his father, and he pleads he had nothing by diſcent, and it is found that he had a reverſion expectant upon a Term for life, of which he had not notice of, yet that will not excuſe, for the law intends that he had notice, and that he ſhall be charged as if it were his own debt, and alſo the deed after the death of his Anceſtor doth appertain to him, and if the deeds are kept from him, he may have an action for them, and beſides, here no man is bound to give him no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, for if it ſhould be given, it ought to be given to the heir, or to the Executors, for they may both ſave the land by the performance of the condition; nay, if there be 20. Coheirs, there ought to be notice given to them all, becauſe they are to loſe their inheritance by that, and it is not like to the caſe which was adjudged, where there are two obligors to make ſuch an aſſurance as the obligee ſhall deviſe, there a deviſe to one is ſufficient, becauſe this concerns a perſonal thing, but otherwiſe when this doth concern an inheritance as here: but I relie upon the reaſon of the firſt forming of the deed, if I am not bound to give notice at the time of the making of the deed, I ſhall not be bound to give notice by any matter <hi>ex poſt facto:</hi> and yet I do agree that in many caſes where a thing is certain at the firſt, and doth refer to ſome future agreement, that in ſuch caſes, there ought to be notice given to the partie, as <hi>Hill.</hi> 12. <hi>Iac.</hi> in this Court <hi>Rot.</hi> 109. where a promiſe was made

is, becauſe he accepted only a fine of the land, and for that it only extends to that and not to the rent, as if a man is ſeiſed of 3. acres, and he accepts a rent of two of them, which render of them all, this is void for one acre; and laſtly, by a feof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of land by warranty a rent is diſcharged, 21. <hi>H.</hi> 7. and here I conceive, that the replication to the bar of the avowrie is not good, for his plea is, that the rent in this caſe is not compriſed, and that is a point in law, whether it is compriſed or no; for if we do take iſſue upon that, we ſhall draw the trial here from the Court to the jury in the Countie, which is not good, and ſo upon all the matter I pray judgement for the Plantiff in the replication.</p>

Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant in tail of a rent made a feofment in fee of the rent with warrantie, and there it is ſaid, that the warrantie did not extend to iſſue <hi>quoad</hi> the rent, but now our caſe is upon the Statute of 32. <hi>H.</hi> 8. which ſaith that a fine ſhall be a bar of my lands, Tenements, and hereditaments any way intailed, but yet I conceive that this requires that the fine be levied expreſly of that, and not by way of conveyance, and ſo the caſe of <hi>Smith</hi> and <hi>Stapleton</hi> by <hi>Thornton,</hi> who ſaid that this was gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to him to be law, which muſt needs be meant it was granted by the Court, or by the Councel of the other ſide, and the reaſon of that is, becauſe it ought to be levied of that expreſly, and there it is ſaid, if Tenant intail of an advowſon, do levie a fine of the nomination, that ſhall not bar the iſſue, and yet in effect that is the advowſon, and becauſe it is not levied of that expreſly, it is not good, and then for the precedent agreement that is indeed, that the fine ſhall be for the extinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the rent, and what then will that prove, that the fine was levied of the rent, and here the writ of Covenant was not brought of the rent, and yet I agree that agreements which do lead uſes of fines, will qualifie them againſt the very nature of the fine, as the caſe of the <hi>Lord Cromwel</hi> and <hi>Puttenham</hi> in <hi>Dyer:</hi> but I do not hold the agreement will extend over the nature of the fine, and therefore this being a rent in groſs, it may paſs by the name of land, and the averment here is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to that which doth appear upon the Record, and then not compriſed is a good plea; but this ſhall not be tried by the Countrie, but by the Record; as 12. <hi>H.</hi> 7. 16. for it is only to inform the Court, that the partie had miſtaken the Law, and ſhall be tried by the Court, and not by a jury in the Countrie, as <hi>Attoe</hi> ſaid, and ſo upon the whole matter of the caſe I conclude my argument, and pray judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for the Avowant: ſee after <hi>Hill.</hi> 22. <hi>Iac.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Hendon</hi> contrary, I hold the award to be good; for though that ſhall be void for the intereſt, yet it ſhall be good for the reſidue, and then the non payment is a breach of the condition, for where an award is made for a thing againſt the law, and for another which doth ſtand with the law, this is good for one, and void for the others, ſo here.

                  <p>ANd the following Term the caſe was argued by <hi>Henage Finch</hi> Serjeant of the King for the Plantiff, and he ſaid, the firſt point is, whether this made a precedent or a ſubſequent condition, in which there had been much Logick uſed, and it had been ſaid, that it is a rule in law, that when a ſtate is firſt limited, and there are words of condition to deveſt, that in that caſe there is a ſubſequent condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which ground I will not denie; but I denie that here the eſtate is firſt limited, for though that ſeems to be in words, yet it is not in the intents of the parties, but here firſt I will note an ordinary difference in our books, that proviſo and <hi>ſub con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditione</hi> are notes of a ſubſequent condition, <hi>(ſi)</hi> of a precedent condition, as appears by <hi>Mr. Littleton;</hi> and the reaſon of this difference is, becauſe proviſo and <hi>ſub conditione</hi> make a full propoſition, and ſo doth not the word <hi>(ſi;)</hi> and I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare that with <hi>Henry Finches caſe,</hi> where <hi>aut</hi> and <hi>alibi</hi> never begin a ſentence, and ſo <hi>(ſi)</hi> never made an entire propoſition: but the propoſition is, that the fine ſhall be to the uſe of the Lady, if <hi>Robert</hi> do not pay, which is an Hypothetical pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition knit with a copulative conjunction, and then the antecedent ought to be <hi>(ſi,)</hi> for all doth depend upon that, but it hath been objected, that this is not an antecedent, for it is put in the laſt place, but I ſay put that where you will <hi>(ſi)</hi> will rule the ſentence, and will have a conſtruction in the firſt place; <hi>(S.)</hi> if <hi>Foyn</hi> do not pay 10. s. the firſt of <hi>September,</hi> then that ſhall be to the uſe of the Lady,

<pb n="120" facs="tcp:95435:67" rendition="simple:additions"/>
now for the words themſelves, I take it that they make a ſubſequent condition, and ſo it is here limited in intention, and for that in matter alſo; and it is ſaid in <hi>Colthirſts caſe</hi> in <hi>Plowden,</hi> that if the eſtate doth firſt paſs reducible upon condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, then it is ſubſequent, and here it is limited to the Conuſee and his heirs, if the Conuſor do not pay: but here it hath been ſaid is <hi>inverſio verborum,</hi> and the conſequent is placed before the Antecedent, and this hath been proved by <hi>Logick:</hi> I never knew caſes in law to be expounded by Logical and Grammatical learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but by the intentions of the parties, and here I conceive that the eſtate is v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

Aſſiſes land given to a man and to his heirs, if he have heirs of his body, now this (if) is ſubſequent, and ſo I conceive that it is not a condition ſimply, but a conditional limitation, for it appears by <hi>Mr. Littleton,</hi> becauſe it is no otherwiſe expreſſed, and another reaſon is, becauſe the condition is annexed to the future time, <hi>ergo</hi> that is ſubſequent, and yet I grant there is a difference betwixt ſuch an eſtate conditional annexed to an intereſt, and where it is is annexed to an authoritie, it may be precedent, but for an intereſt it is ſubſequent, as is the caſe of <hi>Bracton lib.</hi> 2. <hi>fo.</hi> 3. and now for the ſecond point, whether the heir may and ought to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form that, and I do conceive that he is, and it is not annexed to the perſon, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is real, and doth ariſe with the land.

                  <head>The caſe of <hi>Hilliard</hi> and <hi>Sanders</hi> ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gued by the Court.</head>
                  <p>
                     <hi>IUſtice Harvey</hi> this Term did argue the caſe of <hi>Hilliard</hi> and <hi>Sanders,</hi> which ſee before; and after a brief recital of the caſe, he ſaid that his opinion was, that the avowant ſhall not have return, becauſe that by the fine of the lands the rent is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract, and I am induced to be of this opinion by two things, the firſt is the agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>e other is the favourable expoſition of the Statute of fines, to ſettle repoſe and quiet, and I will firſt ſhew the efficacie of fines at the common law; 21. <hi>Ed.</hi> 4. the <hi>Pryor</hi> of <hi>Binghams caſe,</hi> it is laid for a ground and rule in law, if a thing be contained in a fine either expreſly, or implicitly, this is very good: and ſo is 44. <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. 22. 37. <hi>H.</hi> 6. 5. for a fine is no more then an agreement, and therefore it is called in latin <hi>Concordia,</hi> and then ſee if by any words you may paſs this rent by the fine, and though the word rent is not there, yet if it be ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folded in the lands, that is good with that, it is very good, and for that 3. <hi>H.</hi> 7. 16. 17. 21. <hi>H.</hi> 7. proves that by a feofment of the land the rent doth paſs, and wherefore not by fine then, and this ſhall be within the Statute of 4. <hi>H.</hi> 7. and 32. <hi>H.</hi> 8. and a caſe may be out of the Statute of 32. <hi>H.</hi> 8. and yet be within the Statute of the 4. <hi>H.</hi> 7. as the 2. <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. in <hi>Dyer</hi> though the feme after the death of the husband ſhe may enter upon the diſcontinues of the husband, yet if ſhe do not within 5 years ſhe ſhall be barred, and now you ſee that the conſtruction of theſe Statutes was alwayes to ſettle repoſe and quietneſs, for if ſuch a conſtruction ſhould be made according to the opinion of <hi>Chornton</hi> in <hi>Smith</hi> and <hi>Stapletons caſe,</hi> then it will be miſchievous, and for his opinion it was only in the way of arguing, and yet I conceive he had the good opinion of the Reporter, and without all queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:95435:68"/>
it is a caſe of as hard a conſtruction as that is of <hi>Archers caſe,</hi> where the heir who nothing had in the land in the life of his father, did levie a fine, this is a bar for ever, and the reaſon is, becauſe it is of a thing which is intailed, and he cited a caſe in <hi>Bendloes</hi> Reports, where a diſcontinuee was diſſeiſed by Tenant in tail who levied a fine, and the diſcontinuee entred, and then proclamations paſſed, that in this caſe the iſſue was barred; truly I do agree the caſe of 36. <hi>H.</hi> 8. that that a fine levied of land did not bar him who had title of Common, or a way, the reaſon is, becauſe there is no privitie, but in our caſe there is a privitie, and by <hi>Margaret Podgers caſe</hi> a Coppiholder is within this Statute, and in our caſe the rent paſſeth eſpecially in regard of the agreement, as in the <hi>Lord Cromwels caſe,</hi> and he cited a caſe <hi>primo Jacobi,</hi> between <hi>Gage</hi> and <hi>Selby</hi> in an <hi>ejectione firme,</hi> where <hi>Gage</hi> was Tenant in tail, and he levied a fine to <hi>I. S.</hi> in fee, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he levied another fine to the uſe of himſelf for life, the remainder over, and his brother brought a writ of error to reverſe the firſt fine, and ruled that he may not, for the ſecond fine had barred him of any writ of error, and ſo I conclude the fine had extinguiſhed the rent.</p>

                  <head>The argument of <hi>Juſtice Hutton</hi> to the contrary.</head>
                  <p>
                     <hi>HUtton</hi> contrary, the fine had not barred the rent, in which I will conſider the nature of fines at the Common Law, and they were of mightie and great eſteem, and force, as appears by the great ſolemnitie which is uſed in them, as is preſcribed in the Statute of fines 18. <hi>Ed.</hi> 1. <hi>de modo Levandi fines,</hi> and he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed that ſuch a fine by Tenant in fee ſimple will paſs that incluſively, for by the releaſe of all his right in the land a Signiorie is gone. I agree alſo that a fine is but an agreement; but yet it muſt work according to the nature of the thing, as upon a writ of Meaſne, or of right of advowſon, a fine may be levied, and yet it is not levied of the lands, but of the advowſon, or Signiorie, and ſo if the writ of covenant be one thing, and the agreement of another thing, then it is not good, and firſt I will prove, that at the Common law fines have been rejected when the writ of covenant did not contain the thing of which the fine is to be be levied, and if at the Common law a fine was levied of rent, there ought to be a writ of cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of that 18. <hi>Ed.</hi> 2. fines 123. and there the rule is given, that it is againſt reaſon to hold covenant of that which never was, and the rent there never was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, but ought to begin then, and yet it is clear a man may create a rent by fine; but he ſhall not have a writ of covenant of that when it was not in <hi>eſſe</hi> before, and becauſe the concord may not varie from that, therefore it was not received 38. <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. 17. <hi>Knevet</hi> put the rule, that a fine may not be of more then is in the writ of covenant, and when a fine is properly levied of that, it is by way of releaſe: <hi>Fitz.</hi> fine 100. and ſo I conceive here the rent doth not paſs. Secondly, here no man may plead that any fine is levied of this rent, for this is forced in by the name of land, which is abſurd, and contrary: and here is not any fine levied directly of the rent, nor any Silver of the King paid for that, but only by the judgement of conſequence: and now for the Statutes of fines, whether it is a fine within theſe Statutes, and I hold that it is not: and I am of opinion that if the rent had been behinde before all the dayes of proclamation paſs, and the iſſue had accepted, that he is remitted: and the ſame law is, if Tenant in taile of ſuch a rent, and he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge ſuch a fine with proclamations, and the proclamations paſs, now if his iſſue had accepted the rent before the proclamations paſſed, he is remitted: and now for the Statute of 32. <hi>H.</hi> 8. that is not taken by equitie, becauſe it is a Statute of explanation, which regularly may not be inlarged: and ſo appears in <hi>Butler</hi> and <hi>Bakers caſe;</hi> and now for the agreement it ſelf that is not any thing, for this is
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:95435:68" rendition="simple:additions"/>
by a contrary name which may not be good: like to the caſe of the <hi>Lord Cromwel,</hi> for there was an agreement to raiſe a rent by fine, but here is an agreement to paſs a rent by another name, and will any man ſay that if a man agree to levie a fine of rent by the name of an advowſon, that this will paſs the rent; and I think that the caſe of <hi>Thornton</hi> is good law, and ſo is alſo the caſe which is put after that of the advowſon: and yet I agree if Tenant in tail do accept a fine with render to another for years, that ſhall bar him, becauſe that doth not work a diſcontinuance, but otherwiſe where it is for life, and ſo in my opinion the rent remains, and the avowant ſhall have judgement.</p>

                     <hi>HObert</hi> to the contrary, the ſhort queſtion is, whether the rent is extinct by the fine of the land, and I hold that it is, and it is agreed it is a bar againſt the parties themſelves, though not againſt the iſſue, and that being granted I ſee no ſecond reaſon wherefore the iſſue ſhall not be barred, and firſt I am of opinion, that this plea of not compriſed, it is not good; becauſe this fine doth work by way of releaſe, but it was ſaid at the bar, that things ought to paſs litterally in a fine, which I denie, and alſo every informalitie of a fine which is cauſe to reject that, is not a cauſe to fruſtrate that when that is levied, and the words of the Statute are of any lands, Tenements, or hereditaments any wiſe intailed, and if there be any word in the conveyance which will carry that, it is ſufficient, and it ſhall be put upon the conſtruction of the law, and as to that, that the fine ſhall be according to the writ of covenant; but I ſay if there be no writ of covenant, then there is no departure: but it was ſaid, that the Silver of the King was not paid, which I alſo denie, for it was paid incluſively, and the words of the Statute are of any thing any wiſe intailed, and Tenant in taile had as great power to paſs that by fine, as Tenant in fee ſimple: and for the caſe of <hi>Thornton,</hi> I know he was a learned man, but let it ſuffice that he was ſo eſteemed; but for his opinion I do utterly denie that, and I do denie the caſe put by my brother <hi>Hutton</hi> of the Piſcary, for I hold if a man had a Piſcary in another mans land, and levies a fine of that by the name of land, this will paſs the Piſcary clearly, and ſo the ſame if a man have an office appertaining to land intailed, and a fine is levied of that by the name of the land, this ſhall bar the iſſue; and I denie that Statutes of explanation ſhall alwayes be taken litterally, for it is impoſſible that an Act of Parl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
